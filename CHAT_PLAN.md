# Chat — Spec, Design & Execution Plan

The design record for site-wide and in-game chat. Chat is implemented
(`src/components/ChatPanel.tsx`, `src/lib/chatApi.ts`, the chat section of
`supabase/migrations/0001_baseline.sql`, and the `notify-*-chat` Edge
Functions); this document explains why it works the way it does. Issue
numbers below refer to the project this platform was extracted from, and
migration file names (`00NN_*.sql`) to its migration history, which has since
been squashed into `0001_baseline.sql`. Update it as decisions change.

## 1. Problem statement

Issue #466 asks for two chat surfaces:

1. **Site-wide chat** — one shared room, visible on the main page (`HomePage.tsx`),
   above the room lists.
2. **In-game chat** — one chat per game, visible at the top of `GamePage.tsx`.

Constraints from the issue, carried through this whole document:

- Only a signed-in, registered user may **post**. (Reading may be more or
  less permissive — see §2.)
- The feature must ship **disabled in production** until jinxbit flips it on
  deliberately, independent of `main` being promoted to `production`
  (`DELIVERY_PIPELINE_PLAN.md` §3/§4).
- Future, explicitly out of scope for the first cut: `@mention` direct
  messages with a notification, message reporting, and 30-day message
  retention. These are designed below (§7–§9) so the schema doesn't need to
  change shape later, but are not part of the initial execution phases.

Chat is **not a game rule**. It never touches `GameState`, never goes through
`applyAction()`, and is invisible to the rules framework (`packages/sdk`), `replayActions`, or
either write path in `CLAUDE.md`'s "two write paths" section. It also carries
no rule-enforcement concern — there's nothing to cheat at by posting a
message — so unlike `game_state`, chat rows are ordinary client-writable
tables gated by RLS, the same trust model as `players`/`games` themselves.
This keeps the whole feature outside the four engine invariants entirely; no
the rules framework (`packages/sdk`) change is needed anywhere in this plan.

## 2. Scope, proposed

### Confirmed by the issue

- Two chats: one site-wide, one per game.
- Site-wide chat renders above the room lists on the main page.
- In-game chat renders at the top of the game page.
- Posting requires a signed-in, registered user (Discord/Google/email —
  same `useAuth()` session every other write already requires; guest-auth
  sessions, gated behind `VITE_ALLOW_GUEST_AUTH` and testing-only per
  `.env.example`, count as signed in the same way they do everywhere else in
  the app).
- Disabled in production until explicitly enabled (§4).

### Proposed defaults (flag for pushback during review)

- **Reading site-wide chat requires sign-in too.** `HomePage.tsx` already
  renders a completely different, room-list-free view for a signed-out
  visitor (the sign-in screen, `HomePage.tsx:93-116`) — there is no
  logged-out "rooms" view for site-wide chat to sit above in the first
  place, so gating its reads on session as well costs nothing and avoids
  having to moderate a chat surface strangers can read without an account.
- **Reading in-game chat matches who can currently see that game.** Same
  audience `game_state`/`players` already grant: seated players always, plus
  (for a `visibility: 'public'` room) any other signed-in visitor, per
  `0019_public_game_state_visible.sql`/`0021_remove_observers.sql`. No new
  audience concept is introduced.
- **Posting in-game chat is restricted to seated players.** A public room's
  non-seated visitor can read the board and, under this proposal, the chat,
  but not post to it. (Open question §10.1 if this is too restrictive —
  e.g. should a spectator be able to cheer someone on?)
- **One flat channel per surface, no threads/rooms-within-rooms.** Site-wide
  is a single global stream; each game has exactly one stream. No per-team
  or per-DM channels in the first cut (DMs are §8, a distinct future
  mechanism, not a "channel").
- **Hotseat games get in-game chat like any other game.** All local hotseat
  players share one `auth.uid()`, so hotseat chat is really "notes from the
  one signed-in host to themselves" — harmless, and consistent with hidden
  information's existing precedent of hotseat being out of scope for
  anything seat-distinguishing rather than specially blocked.

### Out of scope for the initial phases (designed for, not built — §7–§9)

- `@mention` direct messages and their notification.
- Message reporting.
- 30-day retention/deletion.
- Rich text, attachments, emoji reactions, read receipts, typing indicators.
- Per-game opt-out of chat (`games.settings` has room for this later —
  `CLAUDE.md`'s "add pregame toggles there, no migration needed" — but
  nothing in the issue asks for it yet).

## 3. Data model

One table serves both surfaces; a game-scoped row's `game_id` is set, a
site-wide row's is `null`. This avoids two near-identical tables and lets a
single component (§6) render either surface off the same shape.

```sql
create table public.chat_messages (
  id bigint generated always as identity primary key,
  game_id uuid references public.games(id) on delete cascade,  -- null = site-wide
  sender_id uuid not null references auth.users(id),
  body text not null check (char_length(body) between 1 and 2000),
  created_at timestamptz not null default now()
);

create index chat_messages_game_id_created_at_idx
  on public.chat_messages (game_id, created_at);
```

Notes:

- `game_id` is nullable rather than two tables so RLS, indexing, and the
  future retention job (§9) are all one policy/query instead of two.
- `on delete cascade` means a deleted game takes its chat with it, matching
  how the rest of a game's rows already behave.
- No `updated_at`/edit support — chat messages are append-only, matching the
  "no fake-history" spirit of `actionHistory`'s own append-only rule
  (`CLAUDE.md` invariant 3), even though this table has nothing to do with
  replay. Editing is not requested by the issue.
- `sender_id`'s display name/avatar comes from `profiles`/`useDisplayName`
  exactly like every other player-identity lookup already in the app — no
  denormalized copy of the name onto the row. **Caveat found in phase 2
  (issue #564), corrected in issue #682:** this document originally assumed
  `profiles`' RLS still let a co-player read each other's row, the way
  `0005_discord_webhooks.sql` first set it up. That policy was dropped in
  `0013_discord_notify_backend.sql` once Discord notifications moved
  server-side — years before chat existed — so `profiles` has been
  strictly own-row-readable ever since, full stop, with no co-player
  carve-out. `chatApi.ts`'s `getChatDisplayNames()` (backed by `profiles`)
  was therefore resolving to nothing for *every* other sender, in-game or
  site-wide, and `ChatPanel.tsx` fell back to a generic `'Player'` label for
  all of them, not just strangers. In-game chat has a working fix: unlike
  `profiles`, `players.display_name` *is* readable by any signed-in user
  (`0001_init_schema.sql`), and `ChatPanel.tsx` already receives the game's
  `players` prop for seat-color lookups (§15), so `nameFor()` now resolves
  an in-game sender from `players` first and only falls back to
  `getChatDisplayNames()`/`profiles`. Site-wide chat has no seats to fall
  back to, so it still shows a generic label for anyone the viewer has never
  shared a game with — see open question §10.5, now the accurate statement
  of what's left.
- Soft-delete (a `deleted_at` or `hidden_at` column) is deliberately **not**
  added yet — it belongs to the reporting/moderation phase (§8) and adding
  it there, gated behind that phase's own migration, avoids an unused column
  sitting inert through the earlier phases.

### RLS sketch

```sql
alter table public.chat_messages enable row level security;

-- Site-wide (game_id is null): any signed-in user may read.
create policy "read site-wide chat"
  on public.chat_messages for select
  to authenticated
  using (game_id is null and public.chat_enabled());

-- In-game: same audience game_state grants today.
create policy "read game chat"
  on public.chat_messages for select
  to authenticated
  using (
    game_id is not null
    and public.chat_enabled()
    and exists (
      select 1 from public.games
      where games.id = chat_messages.game_id
        and (
          games.visibility = 'public'
          or exists (
            select 1 from public.players
            where players.game_id = games.id and players.user_id = auth.uid()
          )
        )
    )
  );

-- Post: site-wide needs only a session; in-game needs a seat.
create policy "post chat"
  on public.chat_messages for insert
  to authenticated
  with check (
    sender_id = auth.uid()
    and public.chat_enabled()
    and (
      game_id is null
      or exists (
        select 1 from public.players
        where players.game_id = chat_messages.game_id and players.user_id = auth.uid()
      )
    )
  );
```

`public.chat_enabled()` is the kill switch — see §4. No `update`/`delete`
policy exists yet (nothing needs one until reporting/moderation, §8).

## 4. The kill switch: "disabled until I enable it"

The issue's requirement is stronger than "hide the UI" — mirroring this
repo's own stance on hidden information (a client-side-only hide is "a UX
guarantee, not a security one"), a modified
client must not be able to post or read chat while it's off, not just fail
to render a chat box.

**Proposed mechanism, following the existing `profiles.is_admin` precedent
almost exactly** (`0017_admin_delete_any_game.sql`'s own doc comment: "an
admin grants themselves the flag directly via SQL"):

```sql
create table public.app_config (
  id boolean primary key default true check (id),  -- singleton row
  chat_enabled boolean not null default false
);
insert into public.app_config (chat_enabled) values (false);

create function public.chat_enabled() returns boolean
  language sql stable security definer as
  $$ select chat_enabled from public.app_config limit 1 $$;

alter table public.app_config enable row level security;
create policy "anyone can read app_config"
  on public.app_config for select to authenticated using (true);
-- No insert/update/delete policy at all: nothing in the app can flip this
-- flag. jinxbit turns it on with one statement in the Supabase SQL editor:
--   update public.app_config set chat_enabled = true;
```

Why this over the alternatives considered:

- **A build-time `VITE_CHAT_ENABLED` env var** (the pattern
  `VITE_ALLOW_GUEST_AUTH`/`VITE_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` already use) would hide the
  UI, but Postgres RLS can't see a Vercel/Vite env var, so it can't be the
  *only* gate — something server-side still has to exist. It would also need
  a Vercel redeploy to flip, and would only gate the client, not a direct
  REST/RPC call. A DB-backed flag is strictly simpler: one gate, no
  redeploy, real server-side enforcement, and (since Preview and production
  are separate Supabase projects per `CLAUDE.md`'s deploy section) Preview
  can default to `true` for dogfooding while production stays `false`
  without any extra plumbing — each project's `app_config` row is
  independent by construction.
- **A per-request Edge Function gate** (route all chat writes through a
  `send-chat-message` function, the way rule-enforced games route through
  `apply-action`) would work but adds a Deno cold start and a whole
  Edge Function to a feature with no rules to enforce — RLS alone already
  fully expresses "signed in" and "seated in this game," so there is nothing
  an Edge Function would validate that a `with check` clause can't.
- The client reads `chat_enabled()` once (a cheap RPC call, or folded into
  whatever the client already fetches on load) and hides both chat surfaces
  entirely when false, so a normal user sees no trace of the feature — the
  RLS policies above are the actual guarantee; the UI hide is the ordinary
  courtesy layer on top, same relationship as every other belt-and-suspenders
  pair in this codebase.

This is a single global switch, not a per-game or per-environment
`games.settings` value — the issue asks to gate the *feature*, not any one
game.

**Decision, 2026-09-12 (issue #563): chat is enabled in pre-production only,
automatically, and never enabled in production by any code path.** `main` has
to stay promotable to `production` at any moment for an unrelated change
(`DELIVERY_PIPELINE_PLAN.md` §3), and chat must not ride along when that
happens. The default-`false` seed above already gives that for free on first
deploy; the mechanism for the pre-production half is a step in
`deploy-supabase.yml`, added right after `Push database migrations`, that
runs

```sql
do $$ begin
  if to_regclass('public.app_config') is not null then
    update public.app_config set chat_enabled = true;
  end if;
end $$;
```

over the Management API (`scripts/supabase/set-chat-enabled.sh`, following
`register-database-webhook.sh`'s conventions), guarded by both halves of the
"not production" check the deploy job's "Refuse to touch the wrong project"
step already establishes (`needs.resolve.outputs.environment != 'production'`
**and** the resolved `SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID` isn't
`vars.PRODUCTION_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID`), and soft-failing
(`continue-on-error`) so a flag this low-stakes never fails a migration/
function deploy. There is deliberately no inverse step: production's deploy
never forces `chat_enabled = false`, since that would stomp a deliberate
manual enable. Production is turned on by exactly one hand-run
`update public.app_config set chat_enabled = true;` in the Supabase SQL
editor, same as the mechanism described above minus the automation.

## 5. Realtime delivery

New table added to the `supabase_realtime` publication, the same mechanical
step every existing Realtime-visible table already took
(`0001_init_schema.sql`, `0025_game_state_meta.sql`). Unlike `game_state`
(issue #448's motivation for `game_state_meta`'s slim broadcast — a `GameState`
row is routinely ~200kb), a chat row is a few hundred bytes at most, so there
is no bandwidth reason to split "broadcast" from "fetch": the client
subscribes directly to `postgres_changes` INSERT events on `chat_messages`
(filtered `game_id=eq.<id>` for in-game, `game_id=is.null` for site-wide) and
appends the new row straight from the payload, no follow-up fetch needed.

## 6. UI placement

- **Site-wide** (`HomePage.tsx`): a new `<ChatPanel gameId={null} />` section
  placed right after the header/banners and before the "Create a game" /
  "Join by code" section (`HomePage.tsx:194` today) — i.e. "before the
  rooms" per the issue, since everything from `roomEntries` down (line 219
  onward) is the room lists. Only rendered once `chat_enabled()` is true and
  a session exists (§2).
- **In-game** (`GamePage.tsx`): originally (issue #565) `<ChatPanel
  gameId={game.id} compact canPost={!!ownSeat} />` at the very top of the
  returned JSX, `compact` starting the panel collapsed behind its own
  Show/Hide toggle. **Superseded by issue #580 (§14):** the toggle button
  and its unread badge moved into the header row, to the left of the
  player-name list, and the panel itself — when open — now renders directly
  under that header instead of pinned above it. `canPost` mirrors the "post
  chat" RLS policy (§3/§10.1): false for a signed-in non-seated visitor to a
  public game (GamePage's `ownSeat`, the same "does this session have a seat
  here" check every other panel already gates on), which swaps the composer
  for an explanation instead of letting the post fail on submit with a raw
  RLS error. Hotseat games get no special casing — every local seat shares
  the host's `auth.uid()` (`0003_hotseat_local_players.sql`), so `ownSeat` is
  always found and the composer behaves like any other game.
- A single shared `ChatPanel` component (`src/components/ChatPanel.tsx`)
  parameterized by `gameId: string | null`, backed by a small `chatApi.ts`
  in `src/lib/` (list + subscribe + post), mirroring the existing
  `gameApi.ts` shape. No engine involvement, so no new content JSON, no
  `resolveContent.ts` entry.

## 7. Future: `@mention` direct messages + notification

Not built now; recorded so §3's schema doesn't need to change shape later.

- Parsing `@name` in `body` client-side to render a mention as a link/pill;
  the stored `body` stays plain text (no markup format decided yet — see
  open question §10.2).
- A notification on mention reuses the existing pattern exactly:
  `notify-discord-turn`/`notify-web-push` already fire off a Supabase
  Database Webhook on a table event (`game_state` UPDATE today). A
  `chat_messages` INSERT webhook triggering new
  `notify-discord-mention`/`notify-web-push-mention` functions — Deno
  near-duplicates of the existing two, per those files' own doc comments
  ("Edge Functions can't import the app's Vite-aliased TypeScript sources")
  — needs no new notification infrastructure, only new trigger wiring and
  functions.
- This is naturally a **direct message**, not a broadcast: the notification
  should go only to the mentioned user, unlike today's turn notification
  which already targets a single "whose turn is it" recipient — so the
  existing per-recipient lookup logic in `notify-web-push`/`notify-discord-turn`
  is directly reusable, just keyed off the parsed mention instead of
  `pendingActorIds`.

## 8. Future: reporting

Not built now.

- A `chat_message_reports` table (`message_id`, `reporter_id`, `reason`,
  `created_at`), insert-only by any authenticated user, readable only by
  `profiles.is_admin` — same shape as the `is_admin` precedent in §4.
- An admin review surface, likely a new `/admin/chat-reports` page mirroring
  `AdminRoomsPage.tsx`'s existing `is_admin`-gated pattern
  (`useIsAdmin(session?.user ?? null)`), from which an admin can delete a
  message (needs the `delete` RLS policy §3 deliberately deferred) or
  dismiss the report.
- Whether a reported message auto-hides pending review, or stays visible
  until an admin acts, is an open question (§10.3) — this document doesn't
  pre-decide it since the issue only asks that reporting exist eventually,
  not how aggressive it should be.

## 9. Future: 30-day retention

Not built now. This repo has no existing cron/scheduled-job infrastructure
inside Supabase itself (no `pg_cron` usage in any migration) — the one
precedent for "something runs on a schedule" is `.github/workflows/smoke.yml`,
a GitHub Actions cron. The natural fit is the same shape:

- A new scheduled workflow (or an addition to an existing nightly one) that
  invokes a `cleanup-old-chat-messages` Edge Function (service-role client,
  same trust level as `start-game`/`apply-action`'s service-role writes)
  which runs `delete from chat_messages where created_at < now() - interval
  '30 days'`.
- Alternatively, a plain SQL `security definer` RPC callable the same way,
  if no other logic is needed beyond the delete — simpler than a whole Edge
  Function for a one-line query, at the cost of being one more RPC to
  remember exists. Leaning Edge Function only for consistency with how every
  other scheduled/service-role action in this repo is already exposed, but
  this is a genuinely open, low-stakes implementation choice (§10.4).

## 10. Open questions

Everything else in this document is a proposed default, not a request for a
decision — flag it in review if any default is wrong. These four are
genuine unknowns this document can't resolve on its own:

1. ~~**Can a public room's non-seated visitor post in-game chat, or only
   read it?**~~ **Resolved (issue #563): read-only.** §2's proposed default
   stands — a public room's non-seated visitor may read in-game chat but not
   post to it, enforced by the `post chat` RLS policy's seated-player check
   (§3), not just a UI restriction.
2. **Mention syntax and rendering** (`@name` vs `@userid`, plain-text
   storage vs. some markup) — needed before §7 is scoped into an issue, not
   needed for the initial phases.
3. **Does a report auto-hide the message, or only flag it for review?** —
   needed before §8 is scoped into an issue.
4. **Cleanup job: Edge Function vs. plain SQL RPC** for §9 — low-stakes,
   pick whichever is easier to wire into a scheduled workflow when that
   phase starts.
5. ~~**Should a signed-in user be able to read any other signed-in user's
   `profiles.display_name`, at least for chat purposes?**~~ **Resolved
   (issue #684): yes for `display_name`, never for
   `discord_webhook_url`.** Surfaced in phase 2 (issue #564, §3's caveat),
   corrected in issue #682: today's RLS restricts a `profiles` row to its
   owner only (no co-player carve-out at all, and hasn't had one since
   `0013_discord_notify_backend.sql`), so two people chatting site-wide
   without a shared game couldn't see each other's custom name — the UI fell
   back to a generic label instead. In-game chat doesn't depend on this
   (issue #682 reads `players.display_name` instead), so this only ever
   affected site-wide chat. Shipped as a `security definer` RPC,
   `chat_sender_display_names` (`0035_chat_sender_display_names.sql`),
   mirroring `chat_enabled()`'s own pattern rather than a plain RLS
   relaxation (which would also expose `discord_webhook_url`, since RLS is
   row- not column-scoped): it returns only `(user_id, display_name)` for
   any signed-in caller, so `chatApi.ts`'s `getChatDisplayNames` resolves a
   sender's name whether or not the caller has ever shared a game with them.

## 11. Execution plan

Each numbered item below is meant to become one independent GitHub issue,
sized so later ones don't block earlier ones from shipping and being used.
1 must land before 2/3; 2 and 3 can then proceed independently of each
other; 4–6 (all "future" scope, §7–§9) each depend only on 1–3, not on each
other.

1. **Schema + kill switch.** `chat_messages` table, its RLS policies (§3),
   the `app_config`/`chat_enabled()` kill switch (§4), added to the
   `supabase_realtime` publication (§5). No UI yet. Testable entirely via
   `src/test/supabaseStack/` the same way every other RLS policy in this
   repo is (real Postgres-equivalent policy checks, no Docker needed) —
   see `CLAUDE.md`'s Testing section. Also carries the `deploy-supabase.yml`
   change that enables chat automatically in pre-production only (§4's
   2026-09-12 decision) — that step has nowhere else to live, since it has to
   land in the same PR as the migration it depends on (`to_regclass('public.
   app_config')`).
2. **Site-wide chat UI.** `chatApi.ts`, `ChatPanel.tsx`, wired into
   `HomePage.tsx` above the room lists (§6), gated on `chat_enabled()` and
   session.
3. **In-game chat UI (issue #565, done).** `ChatPanel.tsx` reused unchanged
   in shape, extended with `compact`/`canPost` props, wired into
   `GamePage.tsx` at the top (§6), collapsible for mobile.
4. **(Future) `@mention` + notification** (§7) — needs open question §10.2
   answered first.
5. **(Future) Reporting** (§8) — needs open question §10.3 answered first.
6. **(Future) 30-day retention job** (§9) — needs open question §10.4
   answered first.
7. **Unread indicator (issue #579, done).** `chat_read_status` table + RLS,
   `chatApi.ts`'s `getChatReadStatus`/`markChatRead`, `ChatPanel.tsx`'s badge
   and "new messages" divider (§13). Depended only on 1–3, not on 4–6.
8. **In-game chat position and size (issue #580, done).** `ChatPanel.tsx`'s
   `open`/`onUnreadCountChange` props, `GamePage.tsx`'s header toggle button
   (§14). Depended only on 3 and 7, not on 4–6.
9. **Typewriter look and older-history paging (issue #587, done).** Smaller
   text, a monospace "typewriter" font, a scroll-position fix, and
   `chatApi.ts`'s `listOlderChatMessages` (§16). Depended only on 1–3.
10. **Lobby chat (issue #650, done).** `LobbyPage.tsx` now wires up
    `ChatPanel.tsx` too, with the same `chatOpen`/`chatUnreadCount`/
    `chatEnabled` header-toggle pattern as `GamePage.tsx` (§14) and
    `canPost` gated on `isSeated`. No schema or RLS change: this is the same
    `chat_messages` row keyed on the same `game.id` a room already has from
    creation, so a room's chat starts the moment the room exists and its
    history carries straight over once Start Game flips the room to
    `GamePage.tsx`. Depended only on 3, 7 and 8.

Phases 4–6 are intentionally not started until jinxbit confirms scope/timing
on this document, per the issue's own "Future" heading treating them as
later work, not part of the initial delivery.

## 12. Testing strategy

- **RLS/data-layer:** `src/test/supabaseStack/` integration tests covering
  every policy in §3–§4 — signed-out reject, wrong-seat reject, kill-switch
  off reject, kill-switch on + correct seat accept — the same style already
  used for `game_state`'s RLS (`getGameState.test.ts`,
  `writePathRedaction.test.ts`).
- **Component-level:** `ChatPanel.tsx` behavior (render, submit, Realtime
  append) via `@testing-library/react`, this repo's existing pattern for
  UI components with no engine logic behind them.
- No engine tests are needed anywhere in this feature — by design (§1), it
  never touches the rules framework (`packages/sdk`).

## 13. Unread indicator (issue #579)

Persisted per (user, game) read cursor, so an unread badge is correct across
both a live session and async (return-hours-or-days-later) play — that
persistence requirement is why this isn't just component state, unlike
`collapsed`/`compact` (§6) which genuinely can be.

**In-game chat only.** Unlike `chat_messages`, this feature does not extend
to the site-wide channel on `HomePage.tsx` — there's no natural "done reading
the lobby" moment the way there is for one game's chat, and a global unread
badge next to a chat that's just ambient background chatter isn't something
players asked for. `ChatPanel.tsx` fetches and writes a read cursor, and
shows the badge/divider, only when it's rendered with a real `gameId`; the
`gameId: null` (site-wide) instance never calls `getChatReadStatus`/
`markChatRead` at all.

### Data model

```sql
create table public.chat_read_status (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id uuid not null references auth.users (id) on delete cascade,
  game_id uuid not null references public.games (id) on delete cascade,
  last_read_id bigint not null default 0,
  updated_at timestamptz not null default now()
);
```

- `last_read_id` is a cursor into `chat_messages.id` (the existing
  `generated always as identity` bigint, §3), not a timestamp — no clock
  skew to worry about, and it stays correct across a deleted message in the
  middle of the range without recounting anything, since ids are monotonic
  even with gaps.
- One row per (user, game), enforced by a plain `unique (user_id, game_id)`
  index (`0032_chat_read_status.sql`) — `game_id` is never null here, unlike
  `chat_messages`, so there's no partial-index wrinkle to work around.
- RLS: a user may only see or write their own `user_id`, and only insert a
  row for a game `chat_messages`' own "read game chat" policy would let them
  read in the first place (§3) — gated end-to-end by `chat_enabled()` too,
  same "not just hidden in the UI" posture as the rest of this feature (§4).

### Why update-then-insert, not `.upsert()`

The issue's own spec describes this as `on conflict (user_id, channel_id) do
update`. `chatApi.ts`'s `markChatRead` instead does a conditional `UPDATE ...
WHERE last_read_id < :lastReadId`, and only falls back to `INSERT` (swallowing
a resulting 23505 — the WHERE clause already proved the existing cursor is at
least as far along) when nothing matched. Two reasons, not one:

- It has to never move the cursor backwards — two tabs on the same channel,
  writing at different points in the same debounce window, must not let the
  behind one clobber the ahead one. A raw `ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE` with no
  `WHERE` guard would happily overwrite with a smaller value.
- The production-simulating test stack (`src/test/supabaseStack/`,
  `CLAUDE.md`'s Testing section) doesn't model PostgREST's `ON CONFLICT`
  merge semantics at all — `.upsert()` calls exist elsewhere in this codebase
  (`gameApi.ts`) but none of them are exercised against that stack today.
  Modeling real upsert merge semantics there, correctly, was a bigger and
  riskier change than this feature needed; update-then-insert needs nothing
  new from the double beyond the table itself, and behaves identically
  against real Postgres.

### Updating read state

- The cursor only advances while `ChatPanel.tsx` is both expanded
  (`!collapsed`) and the tab is visible/focused (Page Visibility API +
  `document.hasFocus()`) — matching the issue's "open and visible" rule
  exactly. A closed or backgrounded panel keeps receiving new messages over
  the existing Realtime subscription (§5) so the badge still counts up
  locally; it just doesn't touch the DB until the panel is actually looked
  at.
- Writes are debounced 3s from the last local advance, and flushed early on
  collapse, on the tab losing visibility/focus, or on unmount — the issue's
  "on chat close, on blur, or every few seconds while open, not on every
  message."
- **New player / first-ever open of a game's chat:** rather than
  special-casing seat-join, `ChatPanel.tsx` seeds the cursor the first time
  it loads a game with no existing `chat_read_status` row, setting it to
  whatever the latest message id already was — not 0. This covers a player
  freshly seated in a game with existing history without adding anything to
  the join/seat code path (`gameApi.ts`), and is stricter than "at join
  time" in one respect: it also protects the very first time anyone opens a
  game's chat at all from seeing its entire backlog marked unread.
- **A message is never "new" to its own sender** (issue #586). Both the
  badge count and the divider (below) exclude any message whose `sender_id`
  is the viewer's own `auth.uid()` — the live read cursor already caught up
  to a self-sent message almost immediately in practice (it advances
  whenever the panel is open+visible and `messages` changes, which posting
  triggers via the same Realtime round-trip as everyone else's messages),
  but the divider had no equivalent catch-up at all (next bullet), so a
  message the viewer had just typed themselves could sit under a "New
  messages" divider indefinitely.

### UI

- A numeric badge (1–9, "9+" beyond) next to the "Chat" heading inside
  `ChatPanel.tsx` — shown whether the panel is expanded or collapsed, since
  the heading row itself is never hidden (§6). In-game chat only; the
  site-wide instance never has a nonzero unread count to show one for.
- A "new messages" divider inside the message list, bracketed by
  `readBoundaryId` (the read cursor as it stood before this viewing session)
  and `readBoundaryTopId` (the newest message id already loaded when the
  session started) — only a message in `(readBoundaryId, readBoundaryTopId]`
  and not sent by the viewer can be the divider's target. **Revised, issue
  #586:** the original design snapshotted this boundary once, at the
  component's first mount, and never again — since `GamePage` keeps
  `ChatPanel` mounted across every open/close cycle of its own header toggle
  (§14), that one-time snapshot meant a message arriving *any* later while
  the panel happened to be open (someone else's, or the viewer's own reply)
  still landed after the frozen boundary and was flagged new, even though
  the viewer was watching it arrive live. The boundary now re-snapshots on
  every closed/hidden → open+visible transition (not just the first), and
  `readBoundaryTopId` caps it so a message appended *after* that transition
  — while the session is still open — is never added to what counts as new.
  It still doesn't chase the live cursor as the viewer reads further within
  one session once snapshotted, the same "resets only on remount [or
  reopen], not on every render" posture `collapsed` itself has. Also
  in-game only, for the same reason as the badge.
- **No aggregate badge across games.** A player with several games open in
  other tabs sees each `ChatPanel` track and display its own game's unread
  count independently — there's no shared header across games to put a
  combined count on, and the issue's spec assumed a single shared chat
  toggle this app doesn't have.

### Edge cases

- **Message deleted:** not reachable today — `chat_messages` has no delete
  policy (§3) — but the id-comparison design (`id > last_read_id`, not a
  `count(*)` over a contiguous range) is already robust to a gap in the id
  sequence if that ever changes.
- **Unread count beyond the loaded window:** `chatApi.ts`'s
  `listChatMessages` only ever loads the most recent `CHAT_PAGE_SIZE` (50)
  messages on open. **Older messages can now be paged in by scrolling (issue
  #587, §16)**, but only backwards — the badge still counts unread among only
  what's loaded, which under-counts a true backlog larger than 50, but never
  under-*displays*: once the loaded count already hits the "9+" cap the true
  count doesn't change what's shown.

## 14. In-game chat position and size (issue #580)

Issue #580 asked for the in-game chat toggle to move: when closed, it should
be nothing but a button next to the player-name list with an unread badge on
it; when open, the panel should sit under the player names rather than
pinned above the whole page.

- **`GamePage.tsx`** now owns the open/closed state itself (`chatOpen`,
  `useState(false)`) instead of `ChatPanel` owning it via `compact`. The
  toggle button — a chat-bubble icon plus the same numeric badge style §13
  already used inside `ChatPanel`'s own heading (`chatApi.ts`'s
  `formatUnreadBadge`, moved there from `ChatPanel.tsx` so both callers
  import a plain function rather than a component file) — is rendered in the
  header row, immediately before the player-name `<ul>` (i.e. to that list's
  left, per the issue). `<ChatPanel>` itself moved from ahead of `<header>`
  to right after it, so an open panel renders directly under the row
  containing the player names.
- **`ChatPanel.tsx`** gained two props to support this without duplicating
  its own state: `open` (controlled visibility — when passed, it replaces
  `compact`'s internal `collapsed` state entirely, and the component renders
  nothing at all while `open` is false rather than showing its own
  heading/badge/Show-Hide toggle) and `onUnreadCountChange` (fires whenever
  the live unread count changes, so `GamePage.tsx`'s external button can
  badge itself). The component stays mounted regardless of `open` — its
  Realtime subscription and read-cursor tracking (§13) keep running while
  hidden, the same "collapsed but still live" behavior `compact` already
  had, just with the visible chrome moved out to the caller. `compact`'s own
  self-contained toggle (heading + Show/Hide button) is unchanged for
  `HomePage.tsx`'s site-wide instance, which passes neither `compact` nor
  `open` and stays permanently expanded with no toggle at all, same as
  before.
- No `chat_read_status`/RLS/schema change — this is a pure UI relayout on
  top of §13's existing unread-tracking data flow, just re-plumbed to expose
  the count to an external toggle instead of an internal one.
- **Bug, fixed (issue #608):** moving the toggle out of `ChatPanel` also
  moved it out from behind `ChatPanel`'s own `if (!enabled || !session ||
  !userId) return null` (§4/§6) — the button rendered even with the
  `chat_enabled()` kill switch off (production's default), the only visible
  trace of an otherwise fully-gated feature. `GamePage.tsx` now calls
  `chatApi.ts`'s `isChatEnabled()` itself on mount (the same module-level
  cache `ChatPanel` reads, so this doesn't add a second network round trip)
  and only renders the header button once it resolves `true`. `<ChatPanel>`
  itself is unchanged and still gates its own contents the same way.
- **Header removed (issue #631):** `ChatPanel.tsx`'s own heading (the "Chat"
  label plus, in-game, an unread badge duplicating `GamePage.tsx`'s external
  toggle button) is gone from both surfaces. This also retired `compact` and
  its self-contained Show/Hide toggle — with the heading gone there was
  nothing left to render that toggle in, and no page has passed `compact`
  since this section's own relayout moved in-game chat onto `open`/
  `onUnreadCountChange`; `HomePage.tsx`'s site-wide instance was already
  permanently expanded and stays that way, just without the "Chat" label
  above it. `ChatPanel` still renders nothing while its `open` prop (when
  supplied) is false, and `onUnreadCountChange` still fires so an external
  toggle can badge itself — only the panel's own chrome is gone.

## 15. Sender name colors (issue #581)

Two different color sources, one per surface, both computed entirely
client-side — no schema/RLS change:

- **In-game chat** colors a sender's name with their seat's
  `PlayerRow.color` (the same per-seat color `GameLogPanel.tsx` uses for
  the game log).
  `GamePage.tsx` now passes its already-loaded `players` list into
  `<ChatPanel>` as a new `players` prop; `ChatPanel` looks up
  `players.find((p) => p.user_id === message.sender_id)?.color` — matching
  on `user_id`, not `id`, since `chat_messages.sender_id` is `auth.uid()`
  while `PlayerRow.id`/the engine's own player ids are the `players` row id
  (see `gameGenesis.ts`). A sender not found in the list (in practice
  shouldn't happen — only seated players can post in-game, §2/§10.1) falls
  back to the panel's default `text-neutral-300`.
- **Site-wide chat** has no seat or stored color to look up, and the issue
  asks for a color that's "persistent" without adding one: `chatColors.ts`'s
  `hashDisplayNameToColor()` hashes the sender's display name (FNV-1a) to a
  hue, fixed saturation/lightness, so the same name always renders the same
  color on every client with nothing written or synced. `ChatPanel` omits
  the `players` prop for this surface (`gameId: null`), which is what
  selects this path.

Both paths live entirely in `ChatPanel.tsx`'s new `colorFor()` — no other
file changed.

## 16. Typewriter look and older-history paging (issue #587)

Four requests, all UI/data-layer only — no RLS or schema change:

- **Smaller text.** The message list and composer dropped from `text-sm` to
  `text-xs`; the heading/badge/toggle text (already `text-sm`/`text-xs`)
  were left alone since the ask was about the chat content, not its chrome.
- **Typewriter font.** `index.css` adds a Tailwind v4 `@theme` token,
  `--font-typewriter: 'Courier New', Courier, 'Liberation Mono', monospace`,
  applied to the whole `<section>` in `ChatPanel.tsx`. Deliberately a
  web-safe system stack rather than a bundled or Google-Fonts-linked
  typewriter face (e.g. "Special Elite") — `CLAUDE.md`'s "all copy/artwork is
  original" posture and this app's general avoidance of third-party runtime
  dependencies extend naturally to not pulling in a licensed font file or an
  external font CDN for a cosmetic change. Courier New is an actual
  typewriter typeface and ships on effectively every desktop OS.
- **Allow scrolling.** The list already had `overflow-y-auto`; what actually
  blocked reading history was `ChatPanel`'s own auto-scroll effect, which
  unconditionally reset `scrollTop` to the bottom on every `messages` change
  — including a Realtime message from someone else arriving while the viewer
  had scrolled up to read older text. The effect (now `useLayoutEffect`, so
  the jump-to-bottom or position-restore happens before paint) only snaps to
  the bottom when the viewer was already within `SCROLL_EDGE_THRESHOLD_PX`
  (40px) of it before the update — tracked in a `nearBottomRef` kept current
  by the list's own `onScroll` handler. Standard "don't yank someone back
  down mid-read" chat behavior; unchanged for the common case (new message
  arrives while already following the bottom of the conversation, or on
  first load).
- **Load older rows on scroll.** `chatApi.ts` gains
  `listOlderChatMessages(gameId, beforeId)`, the same shape as
  `listChatMessages` but `lt('id', beforeId)` and reusing the same
  `CHAT_PAGE_SIZE` (50, now exported) so the caller can tell a short page
  means there's nothing older left (`hasOlder` in `ChatPanel.tsx`).
  Scrolling within `SCROLL_EDGE_THRESHOLD_PX` of the top fetches the page
  before whatever's currently the oldest loaded message and prepends it.
  Prepending would otherwise jump the viewport (the content above what the
  viewer was looking at just got taller); `loadOlderMessages` records the
  list's `scrollHeight` immediately before the splice, and the same
  `useLayoutEffect` above restores position by the delta once the new
  `scrollHeight` is known, so the viewer stays looking at the same messages.
  A ref-backed `loadingOlderRef` (not just the `loadingOlder` state used for
  the "Loading older messages…" line) guards against a burst of scroll events
  firing a second fetch before the first one's state update has committed.
  No change to the initial load, the unread cursor, or the "new messages"
  divider — paging only ever prepends messages *older* than anything already
  loaded, so it can't affect what's newest (§13's unread/divider math looks
  only at the newest end).

## 17. Chat text size increase (issue #593)

§16's `text-xs` for the message list and composer read as too small in
practice. `ChatPanel.tsx` raises both back to `text-sm` — the size they were
before §16, and the same size already used for the heading. The typewriter
font (`font-typewriter`) and everything else from §16 (scrolling, paging,
the smaller `text-xs` used for the unread badge, Show/Hide toggle, and "new
messages" divider, which are chrome rather than chat content) are unchanged.

## 18. Per-message timestamps, date separators, and bold names (issue #594)

Three display-only asks, all in `ChatPanel.tsx`; no schema/RLS/data change —
`chat_messages.created_at` already existed and was simply unused by the
panel.

- **`[HH:MM]` timestamp per message.** `formatChatTimestamp()`: minute resolution (a
  chat has no use for seconds), local time, empty string for an
  unparseable/missing timestamp so nothing renders rather than "Invalid
  Date". Rendered as `[HH:MM] ` immediately before the sender's name.
- **Date separators on their own line when the date changes**, "like in the
  log" — the same idea as that panel's `formatLogDate`/`LogPanel` date
  headers, reusing its "once per calendar day, not per line" rule. Chat
  messages render oldest-first (unlike the log, which walks newest-first
  over a reversed array and so tracks "the last date seen" across the
  loop), so the check here is simply whether a message's calendar date
  differs from the *previous* message's — no separate walking state needed.
  The very first message always shows its date for the same reason the
  log's oldest entry does: there is no earlier date for it to match.
- **Bold sender name.** The name span's class changed from `font-medium` to
  `font-bold`; everything else about it (per-seat/hashed color from §15,
  the trailing colon) is unchanged.

No test-visible change to unread tracking, the "new messages" divider, or
paging (§13/§16) — the date separator is purely an extra line inserted
before a message's existing `<p>`, computed from `created_at` alone.

## 19. DOS/abuse defenses (issue #605)

Issue #605 asked for a mechanism (or set of mechanisms) against three chat
abuse scenarios, with "it is ok to disable chat all across the app if there
is an issue" as an explicit fallback. Of the three, two were already covered
by the initial design (§3, §6) with no change needed; the third had no
defense at all until this section.

1. **Oversized messages.** Already enforced, server-side, since phase 1:
   `chat_messages.body` carries `check (char_length(body) between 1 and
   2000)` (`0031_chat_messages.sql`, §3), and the composer's `maxLength={2000}`
   mirrors it for immediate UI feedback. No change.
2. **Harmful strings (e.g. injected markup/script).** Already structurally
   closed: `ChatPanel.tsx` renders `message.body` as a plain JSX text child
   (`{message.body}`), never `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, so React escapes it —
   there is no stored-XSS path through chat. This holds because chat has no
   rich-text/markup interpretation at all (§2, "out of scope for the initial
   phases"); if `@mention` rendering (§7) or any future markup is ever added,
   whatever renders it must keep this same "escaped text, not raw HTML"
   posture. Malicious *content* that isn't executable (a phishing link, abuse)
   is a moderation problem, already covered by the reporting phase (§8), not
   a DOS mechanism — out of scope here.
3. **Flooding (too many messages).** No defense existed. Closed by
   `0034_chat_rate_limit.sql`: a `before insert` trigger on `chat_messages`
   that rejects an insert once its sender already has 10+ rows (site-wide and
   every game combined — one counter per sender, not per channel, so
   switching channels can't be used to dodge it) in the trailing 10 seconds,
   backed by a new `(sender_id, created_at)` index. Deliberately a DB
   trigger, not a client-side throttle: per §4's own reasoning for the kill
   switch, a client-only gate is "a UX guarantee, not a security one" and
   does nothing against a script posting straight through the REST API. Also
   deliberately a trigger rather than folding the check into the "post chat"
   RLS policy (§3), so a rejection surfaces as a plain, readable Postgres
   exception message (shown verbatim by `toAppError`/`ErrorBanner`,
   `src/lib/errors.ts`) instead of RLS's generic "new row violates row-level
   security policy" — the same reasoning behind this repo's existing
   status-transition triggers (`0008_room_lifecycle.sql`,
   `0029_start_game_edge_function.sql`) over a bare check constraint.

   Threshold (10 messages / 10 seconds) is a **proposed default, flagged for
   pushback during review** like every other default in this document — not
   a tuned value from real usage data.

**The kill switch (§4) remains the backstop for anything this section
doesn't anticipate** — per the issue's own assumption, disabling
`chat_enabled` for the whole app (or per-project, since Preview and
production already diverge) is always available if some other abuse pattern
shows up that a per-message rule can't address.

## 20. Notification on chat messages (issue #658)

Distinct from §7's future `@mention` notification: this fires on **every**
message posted in a game's chat, not just one addressed to a specific
player, and it shipped now rather than staying future work since the issue
asked for it directly (unlike §7, which is still gated on open question
§10.2).

- **In-game only, same as the unread indicator (§13).** Site-wide chat
  (`game_id is null`) never notifies — there's no one recipient a broadcast
  message is "for", the same reasoning §13 already used to keep the unread
  badge in-game-only.
- **Async games only, same rule as every existing notify-\* function**
  (`notify-discord-turn`, `notify-web-push`, and the two lifecycle
  functions): a live player already sees a new message the instant it's
  posted over `chat_messages`' own Realtime subscription (§5), and hotseat
  has nobody remote to ping.
- **A new, separate per-player toggle.** Every existing notification (turn,
  lifecycle) reuses one player-level "on" switch: having a Discord webhook
  pasted in, or push turned on, at all. That works because those events are
  inherently rare (once per turn, once per join/start/cancel/finish). Chat
  has no such natural rate limit, so it needed a toggle of its own rather
  than riding the existing switch. The new toggle,
  `profiles.preferences.chatNotificationsEnabled` (issue #658,
  `src/lib/chatNotificationPreference.ts`), reuses the existing
  `profiles.preferences` JSONB blob rather
  than a new column or migration — the same "add a key, thread it through
  `gameApi.ts`'s `getProfilePreferences`/`saveProfilePreferences`" pattern
  `dbTypes.ts`'s `ProfilePreferences` doc comment already prescribes.
  Surfaced on the Profile page as `ChatNotificationSettings.tsx`, styled and
  shaped like the other Profile page settings. Originally
  shipped **off** by default — a player who configured either channel years
  ago for turn pings should not silently start getting pinged on every line
  of a chat conversation — but issue #668 flipped the default to **on**:
  requiring an opt-in was hiding the feature from players who wanted it, and
  the opt-*out* this section already describes covers the original worry
  just as well.
- **Two new Edge Functions**, `notify-discord-chat` and
  `notify-web-push-chat` (`supabase/functions/`), near-duplicates of
  `notify-discord-lifecycle`/`notify-web-push-lifecycle` for the same
  shape. Trigger: a Database Webhook on
  `chat_messages` INSERT. Recipients are every other seated player in the
  message's game (looked up the same way `notify-discord-lifecycle`'s
  `fetchPlayers` does), filtered to those with both a usable Discord webhook
  URL / push subscription *and* the new preference set — read server-side
  via the service-role client, same as `discord_webhook_url` already is, so
  RLS is never in the way. The message body (up to 2000 chars,
  `chat_messages`' own check constraint) is truncated to 200 chars for the
  ping; the full text is only ever a tap away in the game itself.
- **A fourth "Set Up …" workflow, `setup-chat-notifications.yml`.** The PR
  that shipped the rest of this section could not create it — that session's
  GitHub App had no permission to touch `.github/workflows/**` — so it landed
  one commit later with the manual steps documented in the
  meantime. It follows `setup-lifecycle-notifications.yml` step for step
  (same wrong-project guard, same generate-secret-then-register-then-probe
  order, same soft-failing registration with a dashboard fallback in the job
  summary), reusing `register-database-webhook.sh` unchanged with
  `WEBHOOK_HOOKS="chat_messages:INSERT"`. It is the shortest of the four:
  two hooks, not six. Running it is also how these two secrets are rotated.
  The manual steps stay documented in README's "Chat message notifications"
  section, as they are for every other notify-\* function.
- **No test coverage inside `npm run test`**, matching every other notify-\*
  function: none of the six existing ones (turn/lifecycle ×2 channels) are
  exercised by `src/test/supabaseStack/`'s Edge Function registry either
  (`src/test/supabaseStack/edgeFunctions.ts`'s `EDGE_FUNCTION_NAMES` only
  covers the rule-enforcement path — `apply-action`/`undo-action`/
  `redo-action`/`get-game-state`/`start-game`) — these are webhook-triggered,
  not called from client code, and deploy-time/smoke-test verification is
  this repo's existing posture for the whole notify-\* family.
