# Production deployment

The runbook for putting what is on `main` in front of real players.
Design and reasoning live in `DELIVERY_PIPELINE_PLAN.md`; this is the short
operational version.

## The shape of it

| | Pre-production | Production |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Branch | `main` | `production` |
| GitHub Environment | `Preview` | `production` (deploys) + `production-release` (the approval gate) |
| Supabase project | Preview project | production project (`PRODUCTION_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID`) |
| Frontend | Vercel Preview (badge on screen) | Vercel Production (no badge) |

`production` is **only ever fast-forwarded to a commit `main` already
carries**. Nothing else commits to it, so it is an ancestor of `main` by
construction and there is no back-merge to remember.

**Deploying is a side effect of the push, not of the promotion workflow.**
`promote.yml` moves the branch; `deploy-supabase.yml` sees `production` move
and runs `supabase db push` + `supabase functions deploy` against the
production project; `smoke.yml` follows it and replays the checked-in real
games through the freshly deployed Edge Functions; Vercel builds the
frontend from the same push.

## Before you promote

1. **Pre-production is green.** `Smoke -> Preview` succeeded on the commit
   you intend to promote (or on a later one). `promote.yml` refuses to run
   while the latest Preview smoke is red.
2. **CI is green on that exact commit.** Also checked by `promote.yml`.
3. **You have actually used pre-production.** Smoke proves the backend
   replays a recorded game; it does not prove the app works. Play a turn.
4. **Migrations have had a human read.** They never auto-merge, and they are
   the one thing pre-production cannot fully de-risk: they run against an
   empty Preview database and then against real production data.
5. **`production-release` has a required reviewer.** `promote.yml` asserts
   this — an environment with no reviewer would promote unattended.

## Promoting

GitHub -> Actions -> **Promote to production** -> Run workflow. Leave the
`commit` input blank to promote `main`'s head, or paste a full SHA.

The `prepare` job runs first and changes nothing. Read its run summary: the
commit title, whether `main` contains it, whether the move is a
fast-forward, CI's verdict, and the state of the latest Preview smoke. Then
approve the `production-release` prompt. The push is a plain `git push`, so
git itself refuses anything that is not a fast-forward.

## After the push

Watch, in order:

1. **Deploy Supabase -> production** — its "Refuse to touch the wrong
   project" step asserts the resolved project ref against
   `PRODUCTION_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID` before anything is applied, then
   `db push`, then `functions deploy`.
2. **Smoke -> production** — replays the fixture games against the live
   project. It writes real rows, in an isolated private `live`-mode room
   that it deletes afterwards. A failure files an issue (without an
   `@claude` mention — pointing an unattended agent at the live project is
   the maintainer's call).
3. **Vercel Production** — the build carries no environment badge. If a
   badge appears in production, the Vercel environment scoping is wrong.
4. **Open the app.** Sign in, load a real game, take a turn.

## If it goes wrong

**Roll forward.** `production` is fast-forward only and branch protection
forbids force-pushes, so there is no "un-promote": fix on `main`, get it
green in pre-production, promote again.

A Vercel instant-rollback reverts the frontend alone and leaves the new
schema and functions deployed, so use it only when the frontend is the
problem. Migrations have no down step — a migration that needs undoing needs
a new migration.

## Hotfixes

When production needs a fix and `main` is carrying things that are not ready
to go out, **branch the hotfix from `production`, not from `main`.**

`promote.yml` checks that `main` *contains* the commit, not that it *is*
`main`'s head — so a commit branched off `production` and then merged into
`main` satisfies both that check and the fast-forward one, and drags nothing
unready with it.

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout -b hotfix/thing origin/production   # branch from production
# minimal fix, commit -> F
git push -u origin hotfix/thing
```

1. Open a PR into `main` and **merge it with a merge commit, not a squash**.
   A squash rewrites the fix into a new SHA, `F` never exists on `main`, and
   the promote check fails. `automerge.yml` won't do this for you — it wants
   a `claude/` branch with the `automerge` label — so merge it by hand.
   This is also what gets CI green on `F` itself and puts the fix in
   pre-production.
2. Promote **`F`** — the hotfix commit's SHA, not `main`'s head. Its
   ancestry is production's history plus the fix, so that is all production
   gets.
3. `production` is now `F`, still an ancestor of `main`, so the next ordinary
   promotion is still a plain fast-forward. Nothing to back-merge.

**A hotfix should not carry a migration.** Pending migrations on `main` are
numbered below it, so a hotfix migration reaches production *first* and they
apply *after* on the next promotion — the reverse of the order
pre-production tested. `supabase db push` also refuses migrations sorting
before the last one already applied remotely (it wants `--include-all`,
which `deploy-supabase.yml` does not pass), so the next promotion's deploy
can fail outright. If a migration is unavoidable, promote the pending ones
too and accept that it is a full promotion.

Two other things to know going in: pre-production smoke-tests the fix
*merged with everything unready*, while production gets the fix alone — they
only agree if the fix is small and self-contained. And a red pre-production
blocks promotion even for an unrelated reason, exactly when you are in a
hurry; the only way through is to fix pre-production first.

**The real mitigation is upstream.** Per-game config lives in the
`games.settings` jsonb column, so unfinished work can land dark behind a flag
and `main` stays promotable at all times. A `main` that cannot go out is the
thing worth avoiding; flags are cheaper than this procedure.

## One-time setup (already done; here so it can be checked)

- Branch protection on `production`: no force-pushes, no deletions.
- GitHub Environments `Preview` and `production`, each with its own
  `SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD`, `SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID`, `SMOKE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`,
  `SMOKE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`. An environment missing one silently
  inherits the repository-level secret, which is production's.
- `production-release` with a required reviewer, referenced by `promote.yml`
  only. The gate must not go on `production` — deploys and the nightly smoke
  run under that one and would hang waiting for a click.
- Repository variable `PRODUCTION_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID`, and repository
  secrets `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `AUTOMATION_TOKEN`. Without
  `AUTOMATION_TOKEN` the promotion refuses to push: GitHub does not start
  workflow runs from events its own `GITHUB_TOKEN` caused, so the branch
  would move without deploying.
