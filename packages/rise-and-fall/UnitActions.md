# Unit actions — implementation checklist

Tracks implementation of every action in `src/content/units.json` against
`src/engine/unitActions.ts`. Per the units ruleset: playing a card lets the
player choose an action **independently for each unit of that kind they
control** — different units of the same kind may perform different actions
the same round; a unit given no action simply does nothing. Where a chosen
action needs a target hex, the player supplies one per acting unit
(`RESOLVE_UNIT_ACTION`'s `targets`, keyed by unit id — a unit with no legal
target, or none supplied, simply does nothing for that action; others still
act, each paying/gaining independently). `applyResolveUnitAction`
(`src/engine/applyAction.ts`) groups units by which action id they were
each assigned and calls `applyUnitActionEffect`
(`src/engine/unitActions.ts`) once per group — a single shared action
across all of a kind's units, the old assumption, is now just the
degenerate case where every unit happens to be assigned the same one.

**Movement is a normal action, no exceptions.** Every mobile unit kind's
card includes a `move` action alongside its others (see the tables below).
Choosing it works exactly like create/transform/convert: each acting unit
moves to its own target hex (`RESOLVE_UNIT_ACTION`'s `targets`, keyed by
unit id), independently — a unit with no target, or an illegal one,
simply does nothing that turn; the rest still act. See `applyMove()` in
`src/engine/unitActions.ts` and `legalMoveDestinations()` in
`src/engine/movement.ts` (the terrain/cliff/unit-blocking BFS that computes
where a unit may legally move to).

Architecture: `applyAction(state, action, unitContent)` — `unitContent`
(`src/engine/unitContent.ts`) is resolved by the caller from
`units.json`/`terrain.json`/`resources.json` (the engine itself never
imports JSON — same convention as `UNIT_KINDS` in `cards.ts`). The
dispatcher is `applyUnitActionEffect()` in `src/engine/unitActions.ts`.
Tested both with synthetic fixtures (`unitActions.test.ts`) and against the
real JSON content (`unitActions.realContent.test.ts`).

**Cliff rule (applies to all targeted actions):** create, an
`'adj'`-location transform, and convert can never cross a cliff edge —
regardless of the acting unit's own `canCrossCliffs` capability (that
capability is for movement, not these actions) — unless the specific
transform/convert action opts out via `TransformEffect.ignoresCliff` or
`ConvertEffect.ignoresCliff` (e.g. Ship's Transform to Nomad/Merchant, see
the Ship table below and issue #84: a Ship always sits on Water (level 0)
and Forest is level 2, an elevation diff of 2 that the absolute rule would
otherwise always block, despite Forest being explicitly legal terrain per
the card text; and Temple's Convert Enemy Unit, see issue #101: per
ruling, a Temple converts a devoted follower by faith rather than physical
access, so an adjacent cliff edge shouldn't block it).

## Merchant

Split "Buy/Sell Resource" into 4 concrete actions (Buy/Sell × Wood/Stone),
matching how City already splits "Create" per unit type rather than one
generic action with a parameter — `resource`/`mode` are fixed per action
definition, not a resolve-time input, so whichever Merchants a player
assigns to (say) "Buy Wood" all perform that same fixed 1-for-5 conversion;
a straightforward 1-for-5 conversion each way.

| # | Action | Status |
|---|--------|--------|
| 11 | Buy Wood | ✅ |
| 12 | Sell Wood | ✅ |
| 13 | Buy Stone | ✅ |
| 14 | Sell Stone | ✅ |

## Mountaineer

| # | Action | Status |
|---|--------|--------|
| 17 | Produce Resource | ✅ |
| 18 | Transform to City | ✅ |
| 25 | Move | ✅ |

## Ship

| # | Action | Status | Notes |
|---|--------|--------|-------|
| 19 | Transform to Nomad | ✅ | targets an adjacent empty Plains or Forest space; `ignoresCliff` lets it reach Forest despite the Water→Forest cliff |
| 20 | Transform to City | ✅ | |
| 21 | Transform to Merchant | ✅ | targets an adjacent Plains or Forest space, empty or occupied only by a City (`allowedOccupantKinds: ["city"]`, any owner); `ignoresCliff` as above; 2 GP |
| 22 | Trade | ✅ | flat rate per City adjacent to the Ship's whole contiguous sea area, any owner (no own/enemy split), cliffs don't block it |
| 27 | Transform to Temple | ✅ | targets an adjacent empty Plains space only; Water(0)→Plain(1) is never a cliff edge (diff of 1), so no `ignoresCliff` needed, unlike Transform to Nomad/Merchant reaching Forest; 2 stone |
| 26 | Move | ✅ | water-only, `moveDistance: "unlimited"` bounded by its connected water region |

**27/27 implemented and tested** — tests across `unitActions.test.ts`
(synthetic fixtures), `unitActions.realContent.test.ts` (against the real
`units.json`/`terrain.json`/`resources.json`), and `movement.test.ts` (the
`legalMoveDestinations` BFS in isolation).

**Scope note:** this checklist covers the *base game* only. The Tales
variant appends further actions onto these same kinds
(`extraActionsByKind` in `src/content/tales.json`, merged by
`applyTaleModifiers()` in `src/engine/tales.ts`) — Construct the Capital,
Construct a Port (Nomad and Ship), Construct the Bridge, Construct a Bank,
Increase Taxes, Construct the Cathedral. They resolve through exactly the
same `RESOLVE_UNIT_ACTION` → `applyUnitActionEffect()` path and the same
`UnitActionEffect` types (plus the Tale-only `SiteCreateEffect` and
`RegionUnitCountIncomeEffect`), and they only exist for a game that opted
into the Tale that contributes them. See `VARIANTS_PLAN.md` and
`src/content/README.md`'s `tales.json` section; they're tested in
`src/engine/__tests__/tales.test.ts`/`bridge.test.ts`/`capital.test.ts`.

## Resolved questions

All four open questions from the first implementation pass are resolved:

1. **Ship's "Trade"** — no own/enemy split. Flat `goldPerCity` per adjacent
   City regardless of owner.
2. **Merchant's "Buy/Sell Resource"** — it IS a real trade after all: a
   straight 1-resource-for-5-gold conversion, either direction, player's
   choice — but the choice is made by picking *which action* to play
   (Buy Wood / Sell Wood / Buy Stone / Sell Stone are 4 separate actions,
   see above), not a per-unit input at resolve time.
3. **Cliff-crossing on transform/convert** — same rule as create: never
   allowed, regardless of the acting unit's movement capability, *unless*
   the transform/convert action explicitly opts out via
   `TransformEffect.ignoresCliff` (added for Ship's Transform to
   Nomad/Merchant reaching Forest — see issue #84) or
   `ConvertEffect.ignoresCliff` (added for Temple's Convert Enemy Unit —
   per ruling a Temple converts by faith, not physical access, so a cliff
   edge shouldn't block it — see issue #101). `create`'s now-redundant
   `targetHex.crossCliff` field was removed from
   `units.json`/`unitContent.ts` — cliff-blocking is otherwise
   unconditional for every targeted action that doesn't opt out (create,
   `'adj'`-transform, convert). (A game report that first looked like a
   cliff-crossing bug turned out to be an unrelated Merchant "Transform to
   Ship" cost mismatch — see units.json.)
4. **Create + supply cap** — confirmed: create always respects the target
   kind's supply cap (`units.json`'s `supply.byPlayerCount`); a City can't
   create a Nomad if the player already holds their full Nomad supply.
5. **When/how a unit may move** — movement is a normal action, no
   exceptions: every mobile unit kind's card has a `move` action, chosen
   and resolved exactly like create/transform/income/etc. Only units of the
   kind matching the card played can move that turn (a Ship card
   activation can't move a Nomad). Each acting unit moves to its own target
   hex, same as every other targeted action. See `applyMove()` in
   `src/engine/unitActions.ts`.
