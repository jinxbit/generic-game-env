/**
 * Detects newly-claimed achievements: for each achievement not yet claimed,
 * checks whether any non-eliminated player currently holds their full
 * per-player supply of the tied unit kind (`unitSupplyCaps` — the same
 * values as content/units.json's `supply.byPlayerCount`, reused here rather
 * than duplicated into AchievementContent, same as unit actions already do
 * via UnitContent). The first to qualify claims it, permanently —
 * achievements are never revoked, even if that player later drops below the
 * cap or is eliminated (src/engine/elimination.ts). If more than one player
 * qualifies in the same check (simultaneous), turn order breaks the tie —
 * an assumption, since the rules don't specify who's "first" in that case.
 *
 * Call this after anything that can change a player's unit count for a kind
 * — currently only RESOLVE_UNIT_ACTION (create/convert/a destroySelf
 * transform can each change who owns how many of a kind), via
 * applyResolveUnitAction in ./applyAction.ts.
