/**
 * Applies a single validated action to a game state, returning a new state.
 * Never mutates the input. This is the ONLY place game rules are allowed to
 * run — UI and network layers must treat GameState as opaque and always
 * route changes through here so every client (live/async/hotseat) enforces
 * identical rules.
 *
 * `unitContent` (content/units.json's actions/movement, content/terrain.
 * json's levels, content/resources.json's caps — resolved by the caller,
 * see UnitContent in ./unitContent.ts) is needed to resolve
 * RESOLVE_UNIT_ACTION and PLACE_UNIT (for the new unit's movement
 * profile). `achievementContent` (content/achievements.json + the units/
 * terrain VP curves — see AchievementContent in ./achievementContent.ts)
 * drives achievement-claim detection (after RESOLVE_UNIT_ACTION), purchase
 * cost (PURCHASE_CARD), and the game-end/win check (once the purchase
 * phase finishes). `boardGenerationContent` (content/terrain.json's tile
 * shapes/placesOn/pool sizes — see BoardGenerationContent in
 * ./boardGenerationContent.ts) drives PLACE_TILE. `taleContent`
 * (content/tales.json's Fantastic Events for the game's active Tales —
 * see TaleContent in ./taleContent.ts) drives Fantastic Event resolution
 * once the purchase phase finishes (see finishRound in ./round.ts). All
 * four are optional and default to empty so callers that don't touch that
 * content aren't forced to pass it.
 *
 * PLACE_TILE/PLACE_UNIT are handled before the status guard below, since
 * they're the only actions valid during `status: 'boardSetup'` — every
 * other action requires `status: 'active'`.
 *
 * Every accepted action is appended to the returned state's
 * `actionHistory` (event sourcing — see GameState.actionHistory's doc
 * comment) via a thin wrapper around the actual dispatch logic below, so
 * every caller gets this for free without each individual apply* handler
 * needing to remember to do it.
 *
 * Per jinxbit's 2026-09-05 design update (RULE_ENFORCEMENT_PLAN.md
 * §4.2/§4.3): once `action` lands, any forced single-option follow-up it
 * leaves behind (a one-card hand's CHOOSE_CARD, a hand+discard that exactly
 * matches what's still owed, a tile placement with only one legal
 * arrangement left) isn't a real decision for anyone to make — nobody
 * "did" it, so it doesn't get its own `actionHistory` entry either. Instead
 * runActionAndForcedFollowUps below keeps dispatching whatever's forced,
 * converging to a fixed point, all folded into the SAME log entry as
 * `action` itself, the same way an ordinary phase transition
 * (beginActionsPhase/finishRound/eliminatePlayersWithNoCardToDecline/etc.)
 * already chains forward within one dispatch rather than becoming its own
 * entry. This is exactly why `applyAction` stays a pure one-action-in,
 * one-log-entry-out reducer even though it may internally dispatch more
 * than one Action: replayActions() (./replay.ts) calls this once per
 * already-logged entry to reconstruct state, and since the forced
 * follow-ups are a deterministic function of state, replaying just `action`
 * again reproduces the exact same cascade — nothing about it needs (or
 * gets) its own entry to replay from. gameLog.ts's narration wants the
 * step-by-step breakdown back for display purposes only; see
 * applyActionWithSteps below for that.
 *
 * `trustedReplay` skips PLACE_TILE's legality/room-search recheck (see
 * placeTile's `skipLegalityCheck` in ./boardSetup.ts) — safe only for an
 * action already known-legal, i.e. one being *replayed* from
 * actionHistory rather than freshly submitted by a player: pass `true`
 * from a reconstruction path (replayActions, gameLog's
 * extendGameLog, turnReview's buildTurnReview), never from a live
 * submission, which still needs the real check to reject an actually
 * illegal placement.

/**
 * Round step 2, rules 3 & 4's action part: resolves one or more of the
 * active player's units immediately — applied right away, not staged
 * behind a later submit — which is what lets one unit's effect
 * (e.g. a Nomad producing a resource) be visible before the player even
 * chooses a later unit's action (e.g. a second Nomad spending it to
 * convert), and lets a global Undo roll back exactly one unit's action
 * instead of a whole turn. `unitActions` is usually a single assignment
 * (the UI submits one per pick — see RoundView.tsx) but stays a list for
 * flexibility/ordering when it isn't; each entry resolves fully (via
 * applyUnitActionEffect in ./unitActions.ts, restricted to just that one
 * unit id) before the next begins. A unit already in
 * `resolvedUnitIdsThisTurn`, or given an id that isn't one of the kind's
 * actions, is skipped. Rejects if nothing in the list actually resolved,
 * so a no-op can never produce a vacuous actionHistory entry. Also checks
 * for newly-claimed achievements (see updateAchievementClaims in
 * ./achievements.ts), since create/convert/a destroySelf transform can
 * change how many of a kind a player controls.
 *
 * If this resolve happens to be the acting player's LAST unresolved unit
 * of the played kind, the turn ends automatically right here (via
 * finishActionsTurn) — no separate PASS_ACTIONS needed once there's
 * genuinely nothing left to decide. Still exactly one actionHistory entry
 * either way, since that's just this same dispatch's result.
 *
 * Tale "companion piece" support: a unit whose kind isn't the played
 * card's own kind, but IS one of that kind's companions
 * (unitContent.companionKindsByCardKind — e.g. Port is a companion of
 * Ship), may also act here, using ITS OWN kind's actions (not the played
 * card's). A companion unit created earlier THIS turn may not act at all
 * (every companion Tale states "cannot be activated on the turn it is
 * constructed" — tracked via GameState.unitsCreatedThisTurn); the played
 * card's own kind has no such restriction, so e.g. a Ship freshly built by
 * a Port's Construct a Ship action can still act the same turn.
