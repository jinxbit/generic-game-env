 *
 * `companionKindsByCardKind` (UnitContent.companionKindsByCardKind — e.g.
 * `{ city: ['capital'] }`, `{ temple: ['cathedral'] }`) counts a companion
 * unit as one of its card kind for this purpose too: e.g. a player with a
 * Capital and no plain Cities still keeps their City card in hand rather
 * than losing it back to supply, since the Capital "counts as a normal
 * City" per the Tale rule text. Defaults to empty for callers with no Tale

 * (e.g. Transform [last] Ship into Merchant) sits correctly untouched in
 * `discard` for the rest of that round, but must not be left there
 * indefinitely: rule 5 still says it belongs in `supply`, not `discard`,
 * once nothing backs it. Previously this correction only ever ran as a
 * side effect of `finishRound`'s rule 10/11 recycle (dumping `discard`
 * into an emptied `hand`, then re-syncing) — which meant an unbacked
 * discarded card sat there, wrongly, until its owner happened to empty
 * their *entire* hand through play, which could take several more rounds.
 * Call this at every round end instead, before that recycle step, so the
 * correction isn't gated on it.
