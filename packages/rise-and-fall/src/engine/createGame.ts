 * Builds a fresh lobby-status game: board is set but no units are placed

 *
 * `resourceBank` should be content/resources.json's `globalSupply.
 * byPlayerCount` looked up for `players.length` — the engine stays
 * content-agnostic (see UNIT_KINDS in ./cards.ts), so the caller resolves
 * it. Optional and defaults to empty (no resources) so existing
 * callers/tests that don't touch it aren't forced to pass it.
 *
 * `activeTaleIds`/`gameLength`/`hiddenInformationEnabled`/
 * `lockRevealedInformationEnabled` are just carried into the resulting
 * GameState verbatim (see GameState's own doc comments) — the engine never
 * interprets any of them itself, so all four are optional and default to
 * "off"/"unset" (`[]`/`Infinity`/`false`/`false`) for callers/tests that
 * don't care.
