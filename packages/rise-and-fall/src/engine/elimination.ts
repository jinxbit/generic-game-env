/**
 * Rule: a player is eliminated if they have to play a card — choosing one
 * in the select-cards phase, or giving one up in the decline phase — and
 * have none available. They're removed from the board and turn order for
 * the rest of the game, and excluded from winning (callers of
 * determineWinners in ./victoryPoints.ts should pass only non-eliminated
 * player ids). Achievements they've already claimed are NOT revoked. All
 * of their gold/wood/stone is returned to the shared bank.
 *
 * Also ends the game immediately once this elimination leaves at most one
 * player standing — bug report: "a game with only one player remaining
 * didn't finish." No VP comparison needed (unlike the normal gameLength
 * win check in round.ts's finishRound): the sole survivor trivially wins
 * outright, and if this elimination wipes out the very last player too
 * (an all-players-simultaneously-eliminated edge case), the game still
 * ends, just with nobody to declare (`winnerPlayerIds: []`). Callers that
 * chain straight into the next round phase once every pending player has
 * been resolved (beginSelectCardsPhase/beginDeclinePhase in ./round.ts,
 * applyMoveToDecline in ./applyAction.ts) must check `status` before doing
 * so — completed here means stop, not "safe to advance."
 *
 * `conceded` just stamps Player.conceded for presentation (see its doc
 * comment in ./types.ts) — applyConcede (./applyAction.ts) passes `true`;
 * every other caller here is an automatic no-card elimination and leaves it
 * `false`.
