 * `movement.blockedByUnits` blocks. Stops at `movement.moveDistance` steps,

 * to legally go, which in practice means a unit restricted to a single
 * terrain type (like Ship's Water-only) can never leave its connected
 * region of that terrain, since every step must land on it too.
 *
 * Ending a move requires the destination to be empty, or occupied only by
 * kinds in `movement.canEndMoveOnUnitTypes` — that's independent of
 * `blockedByUnits`, which only governs passing *through* a hex, not
 * stopping on one; a hex can be legal to move through but not to land on.

 * as the cliff checks in ./unitActions.ts), passed in explicitly per the
 * engine's content-agnostic convention.
