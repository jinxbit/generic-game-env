 * HIDDEN_INFORMATION_PLAN.md §2/§5.1:
 *
 * - While `roundPhase === 'selectCards'` and any player is still pending,
 *   another player's already-made pick is visible as "they've chosen" but
 *   not *what* they chose.
 * - While `roundPhase === 'decline'`, cards another player has moved to
 *   decline *during this still-in-progress phase* are hidden; their
 *   already-public decline pile from earlier rounds is not.
 * - While `roundPhase === 'purchase'`, a card another player has bought back
 *   from decline *during this still-in-progress phase* still shows as if it
 *   were in decline (issue #600). The purchase phase became simultaneous in
 *   issue #553 ("the same shape as selectCards/decline") but was
 *   deliberately left unmasked at the time on the reasoning that a player's
 *   decline pile was already public either way (todo.md #97) — true of the
 *   pile's *contents*, but once the phase is simultaneous, *which* card a
 *   still-pending player just bought back is exactly the same secret
 *   CHOOSE_CARD already keeps against a fully-public hand, and the VP a
 *   bought-back card's units immediately start contributing again
 *   (calculateBoardCountVP/isCardDeclined, ./victoryPoints.ts) was visibly
 *   changing for opponents mid-phase as a result.
 *
 * Everything else (hands, discard, board, resolved decline piles,
 * resources, VP, etc.) is public per §2 and passes through unchanged.
 *
 * Pure and side-effect-free, like the rest of src/engine/ — the caller
 * (the `get-game-state` Edge Function, see §5.2) is responsible for
 * actually keeping this the only view an opponent's client ever receives.
 *
 * Also redacts `actionHistory` (added 2026-09-08, alongside `get-game-state`
 * becoming the redacted read path an app client actually calls —
 * RULE_ENFORCEMENT_PLAN.md §8 phase 8): the raw log's own CHOOSE_CARD/
 * MOVE_TO_DECLINE entries carry the exact same secret `cardId` payload
 * chosenCardIdByPlayerId/declineCardIds mask above, under the same two
 * conditions (still-pending selectCards, or this-phase-only decline
 * additions) — so scrubbing only the derived fields and shipping the raw
 * log alongside them would leak the very same value straight back out. A
 * single-card RETRACT_DECLINE is masked the same way (issue #505): once
 * `handleUndo` (GamePage.tsx) started actually dispatching this action, a
 * still-masked MOVE_TO_DECLINE could be immediately followed by an
 * unmasked RETRACT_DECLINE naming the very card the addition was hiding —
 * masking both closes it. (The no-`cardId` "retract everything this phase"
 * form this action gained for that same fix has no payload to leak in the
 * first place.) This still doesn't cover a raw-row Realtime broadcast
 * bypassing this function entirely (§5.2's original concern) — but
 * `subscribeToGameState` (`src/lib/gameApi.ts`) already subscribes to
 * `game_state_meta`, not `game_state` itself (issue #448, for bandwidth,
 * before this document even had a redaction concern), so nothing broadcasts
 * the raw row over Realtime today regardless.
 *
 * §5.3's "reveal high-water mark" (keeping an already-resolved phase from
 * flickering back to masked for a viewer who rewinds *review-only*, with no
 * branch, back into it) was scoped for this function but dropped per
 * jinxbit, 2026-09-06: this always derives strictly from `state`'s own
 * `roundPhase`/`pendingPlayerIds`, so a reviewed-but-not-branched rewind
 * re-masks an already-seen phase exactly as if it hadn't resolved yet. This
 * is a display flicker on review, not a leak (the viewer's own client
 * already rendered the real value before the rewind), and dropping it is
 * what let `get-game-state` ship as a straight read of the live state
 * instead of needing a full engine replay to compute the mark.

 * type threaded through the client. The only caller is gameApi.ts's
 * getGameStateRedacted.
 *
 * Two fields are genuinely lossy, both deliberately:
 * - `chosenCardIdByPlayerId`: `{chosen: true, cardId: null}` (masked, but
 *   chosen) collapses to `null`, same as `{chosen: false}` (not chosen) —
 *   indistinguishable once collapsed. Every current reader of another

 *   once `roundPhase === 'actions'`, by which point that phase has

 *   redactStateForPlayer) — so this collapse never actually loses
 *   information a reader depends on today. A future reader that wants to
 *   show "chosen, not yet revealed" during selectCards itself would need to
 *   consume `RedactedChoice` directly instead of calling this function.
 * - `players[].declineCardIds`: a this-phase decline addition is kept as
 *   `null` in place (array length/order otherwise preserved) rather than
 *   filtered out — every reader (kindsInZone/sortCardIdsForDisplay in
 *   RoundView.tsx/EndGameView.tsx) already does a `cards[id]` lookup that
 *   quietly drops an unrecognized id, so a `null` here just under-counts a
 *   still-secret pile by omission rather than crashing or fabricating a
 *   value. A this-phase purchase (buy-back) is the mirror image — the real
 *   id is *appended* rather than replacing a slot in place, since there's no
 *   original position to restore it to — so length/order is preserved for
 *   an addition but not for a removal; either way this only ever touches an
 *   *other* player's pile, never the viewer's own.
 *

 * whatever it was right after the event's own action applied — on every
 * call rather than baked into the event once at narration time: an entry
 * that was secret when logged (some players still picking) needs to read as

 * can only be known once later actions (other players' own picks) have
 * happened. `event.secret.turn` guards against a *new* round's still-secret

 * has moved on.
 *
 * `events` themselves are never mutated — everything else (the fully-
 * revealing log ./gameLog.ts builds) stays the shared, cacheable source of
 * truth; this returns a per-viewer copy for display only.
 *
 * Also synthesizes a "chose a card" line for a still-pending player whose

 * `hiddenInformationEnabled` game, `get-game-state` never sends that entry
 * to another player's client in the first place (`unredactedPrefix` above

 * nothing in `events` for the map above to redact — the map only handles the
 * client-trusted path, where the real (fully-revealing) event always exists
 * and just needs its message swapped. `pendingPlayerIds`/`turnOrder` are
 * never themselves secret (redactStateForPlayer never touches them), so
 * "who's no longer pending" is a reliable, redaction-independent source for
 * this even though the log entry itself may be missing. A no-op on the
 * client-trusted path, where `announced` already covers every such player.
 * The synthesized line's own `adminMode` tag (issue #536) can only read
 * `state.adminModeActive` — the *current* value — rather than the real
 * entry's `LoggedAction.viaAdminMode`, since that entry was never sent to
 * this client to read it from.
 *
 * `revealOrderHint` (issue #720) fixes these synthesized lines' own relative
 * order: with nothing else to go on, `unannouncedPickers` used to list them
 * in seat order (`state.turnOrder`), which has no relationship to the order
 * the picks actually happened in — a single state snapshot carries no memory
 * of that. `state` alone still doesn't; the caller (GamePage.tsx) does,
 * because it watches the same game's `pendingPlayerIds` shrink one real pick
 * at a time across successive realtime updates and remembers that reveal
 * order for the current turn. Passing it through lets these lines match the
 * order players actually picked in whenever the caller observed it happen
 * incrementally; a player who left `pendingPlayerIds` before the caller ever
 * saw them pending (e.g. a cold load partway through the phase) isn't in the

 *
 * Deliberately keyed on `resolveHistory(...).effective`, not "the first
 * masked entry in raw order" (issue #498): a masked entry that's since been

 * by replayActions() either, which only ever walks `.effective` — so it's
 * safe to keep it, `cardId: null` and all, in the returned array rather than

 * carry no secret and are never masked themselves (see redactStateForPlayer),
 * so truncating at an already-undone masked entry used to throw away every
 * real entry that came after it too — including the very UNDO_ACTION that
 * undid it — which corrupted every other viewer's client-side
 * resolveHistory().canRedo (the Redo button) and made both the undoer and
 * the undone player's own client disagree with the server about whether
 * anything was redoable. A masked entry that's still effective (the
 * ordinary "still-pending selectCards" case) is unaffected by this change —
 * see this function's git history for the previous, simpler version and its
 * own reasoning about why truncating there is safe (nothing downstream of a
 * masked entry changes VP/resources/board, and `pendingPlayerIds`/
 * `roundPhase`, never masked, already tell a viewer "N players still
 * deciding" independent of this).
 *
 * The original caller is gameApi.ts's toClientGameState — the client-side
 * collapse of a RedactedGameState response back into a plain GameState the
 * rest of the app (gameLog.ts, turnReview.ts, scoreHistory.ts, unitValue.ts,
 * historyFold.ts — none of which know anything about redaction) can keep
 * consuming completely unmodified. get-game-state/index.ts also calls this
 * directly now (issue #647), server-side, to find where the current safe
 * prefix ends when answering a `sinceActionIndex` request — the exact same
 * cut point toClientGameState would land on, just computed once on the
 * server instead of implicitly assumed by the client's splice.
 *
 * One more exception on top of the UNDO/REDO one above (issue #527): a
 * masked CHOOSE_CARD closed by that same player's own later RETRACT_CHOICE
 * doesn't gate the cut either, even though RETRACT_CHOICE isn't UNDO/REDO
 * and so doesn't touch `.effective` at all. Unlike the entries this function
 * otherwise treats as unsafe, a *retracted* pick is never going to become
 * legal to replay later — gameLog.ts's extendGameLog already knows to treat
 * both halves of a masked-choose/retract pair as narration-only no-ops (see
 * isMaskedRedactionEntry/isRetractionOfMaskedChoice there) precisely so this
 * function can keep going past them instead of truncating the entire rest
 * of the game's log the moment any player so much as reconsiders a pick.
 * MOVE_TO_DECLINE/RETRACT_DECLINE/PURCHASE_CARD don't get the same
 * treatment: a masked RETRACT_DECLINE is itself always masked too (see this
 * comment's opening paragraph), and there's no way to retract a PURCHASE_CARD

 * derived here from `actionHistory` rather than stored as separate state.
 * `MOVE_TO_DECLINE` is only ever logged while `roundPhase === 'decline'`
 * (applyMoveToDecline, ./applyAction.ts) and a round has at most one
 * decline phase, so filtering `actionHistory` down to this round's
 * (`turn === state.turn`) `MOVE_TO_DECLINE` entries exactly recovers this
 * phase's still-secret additions — robust to ordering, and to CONCEDE/
 * eliminations interleaved mid-phase, since neither ever touches
 * `declineCardIds` itself. Also used to mask a RETRACT_DECLINE entry naming
 * one of these same cards (see redactStateForPlayer) — deliberately never
 * recomputed to drop a card once it's retracted, since a retraction naming
 * it is exactly the payload that would otherwise leak it.
