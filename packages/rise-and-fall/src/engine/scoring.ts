/**
 * Victory-point source 3 (terrain control): the board is partitioned into
 * maximal regions of grid-adjacent hexes that share the same *effective*
 * terrain (see `terrainScoresAs` below). Each region is checked for unit
 * majority — the player with strictly more units on hexes within that
 * region than any other player scores `terrainVictoryPoints[region terrain]`
 * once per hex in the region. A region with no single player in the lead
 * (including an empty region, or a terrain id missing from
 * `terrainVictoryPoints`) scores nothing, for anyone.
 *
 * Units are counted individually per hex — two units from the same owner
 * stacked on one hex count as 2 toward that owner's regional total; the
 * rules don't say otherwise yet.
 *
 * Per ruling, cliff edges do not affect region shape — only terrain type and
 * grid adjacency do (the current `Tile` model has no per-edge cliff data to
 * consult anyway).
 *
 * Deliberately takes `board`/`units`/`terrainVictoryPoints`/`terrainScoresAs`
 * rather than a full `GameState`: terrain-id agnostic (works against both
 * the engine's current placeholder `Terrain` union and the real 5 terrain
 * types from content/terrain.json), and keeps content data as explicit
 * parameters per the engine's pure data-in/data-out convention (see
 * UNIT_KINDS in ./cards.ts). Real board generation doesn't exist yet, so
 * this can't run against an actual game board — it's written and tested
 * against synthetic ones, ready to plug in once it does.
 *
 * @param terrainScoresAs Per ruling, a terrain id can be merged into another
 *   for scoring purposes — e.g. content/terrain.json has Glacier's
 *   `scoresAs: "mountain"`, so Glacier hexes are grouped into (and use the
 *   VP value of) Mountain regions instead of forming their own; they also
 *   don't break a Mountain region's contiguity. A terrain id missing from
 *   this map defaults to itself (no merge).
