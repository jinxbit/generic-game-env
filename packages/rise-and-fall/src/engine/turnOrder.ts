 * simultaneous (everyone in `pendingPlayerIds` at once, not just the head of
 * the queue) — only actions is turn order, where `pendingPlayerIds` is the
 * rest of the round's queue, not who's allowed to act *right now*, so that
 * one alone returns just the single active player. Used to diff "who newly
