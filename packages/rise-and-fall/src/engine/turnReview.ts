 * has already raced ahead of the `ReviewPhaseGroup` (see `reviewPhaseGroupAt`)
 * this stop is actually showing:
 *
 * - Right at (or after) a completed `actions` review stop: just like
 *   `applyChooseCard` flips `roundPhase` straight to `'actions'` the instant
 *   the last `selectCards` pick lands (see `shouldShowCardChoiceRecap`'s own
 *   doc comment), `beginPostActionsPhase` (round.ts) chains the *last*
 *   acting player's stop straight into `'decline'`/`'purchase'` — and, if
 *   that phase itself has nothing pending (e.g. no achievement was claimed
 *   this round, or nobody has anything to decline yet), straight on through
 *   `finishRound` into the *next* round's `'selectCards'` (or `'completed'`)
 *   — the instant that player's last action lands. So a stop `reviewPhaseGroupAt`
 *   still classifies as `'actions'` (i.e. this is genuinely the last acting
 *   player's own turn, not yet the decline/purchase group's turn) can no
 *   longer trust `state.roundPhase` to still read `'actions'` either.
 *   Reports `'actions'` unconditionally for this group — mid-phase, before
 *   any chaining, `state.roundPhase` already reads `'actions'` anyway, so
 *   this only ever changes the one already-chained stop, never a genuine
 *   mid-`actions` one.
 * - Right at a completed `declinePurchase` review stop: `applyMoveToDecline`/
 *   `applyPurchaseCard`/`applyPassPurchase` chain the same way, straight
 *   through `finishRound` into the *next* round's `beginSelectCardsPhase`
 *   (or straight to `status: 'completed'`) the instant the group's last
 *   action lands — so by the time this stop is reached, `state.roundPhase`
 *   no longer reads `'decline'`/`'purchase'` at all, even though the recap
 *   should still show what was just declined and purchased. Reports
 *   `'purchase'` for that case instead.
 *
 *   `stopEnd < actionHistory.length` (a genuinely earlier, already-passed
 *   stop) is enough on its own to know the group's last action is behind us
 *   — `findTurnStops` only ever draws a boundary once the *next* action's
 *   group has changed. At the live tail (`stopEnd === actionHistory.length`,
 *   i.e. "now"), there's no next action to check, so only `state.status ===
 *   'completed'` gives that same guarantee; otherwise `state.roundPhase` is
 *   trusted as genuinely still `'decline'`/`'purchase'`, mid-phase (matching
 *   `shouldShowCardChoiceRecap`'s existing "never mid-pick" rule for
 *   `'decline'`, and its existing turn-order partial-reveal allowance for
 *   `'purchase'`). The `'actions'` case above needs no equivalent live-tail
 *   guard: unlike `'decline'`/`'purchase'`, `'actions'` is never itself a

 * unequal to any real stop and so still shows. Action-by-action ("Review
 * history") mode has no multi-stop group at all, so `historyStepMode !==
 * 'turn'` always passes once the phase itself is right.
 *
 * The comparison also checks `recapTurn` (see `recapTurnFor`), not just
 * `roundPhase` (issue #331): `roundPhaseForRecap` reports the bare string
 * `'actions'` both for the tail stop of a round that auto-chained straight
 * through an empty decline/purchase phase (see its own doc comment) AND,
 * completely separately, for the very next round's own first `'actions'`

 * that can now appear inside the window (design change, issue #412):
 * unlike every other entry, those aren't a forward step from `state` via
 * applyAction — see resolveHistory (./historyFold.ts) — so this falls back
 * to a full replayActions() over everything before and within the window

 * to stay correct for whatever comes next in the window.
