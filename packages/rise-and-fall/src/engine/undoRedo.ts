/**
 * Submits one UNDO_ACTION entry against `state`, live-style (see
 * applyAction's own doc comment for the "live callers route through here,
 * not a raw history splice" convention this mirrors): appends an entry, then
 * re-derives the whole GameState via replayActions, which knows how to fold
 * it in (see resolveHistory, ./historyFold.ts). `genesis` — reconstructed by
 * the caller, same as every other genesis-needing engine entry point (e.g.
 * GamePage.tsx's handleUndo, the undo-action Edge Function) — is needed
 * because, unlike every other action, undoing isn't a step forward from
 * `state`; it's a shorter replay from the start.
 *
 * One call here always reverts exactly the tip's own actionHistory entry —
 * per jinxbit's 2026-09-05 design update (RULE_ENFORCEMENT_PLAN.md
 * §4.2/§4.3), a forced single-option follow-up (a one-card hand's
 * CHOOSE_CARD, a tile placement with only one legal arrangement left) is
 * folded into the SAME entry as whatever triggered it rather than getting
 * one of its own (see applyAction.ts), so there's nothing left to walk back
 * past here (issue #131's original fix, since superseded): undoing that one
 * entry naturally reverts the triggering action and everything it forced in
 * one step. The one exception is `SET_ADMIN_MODE` (issue #545): it's never
 * "the tip" for this purpose, however recently it was logged — see
 * walkHistory's doc comment (./historyFold.ts) — so `canUndo` below reflects
 * whether there's a real gameplay entry to revert, not merely whether
 * `.effective` is non-empty.
