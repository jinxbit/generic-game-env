/**
 * Cumulative gold gained per (player, unit kind) across the whole game
 * (issue #335's "gold produced by the unit over the entire game"), not just
 * whatever's currently in the bank — replays `actionHistory` from `genesis`
 * the same way calculateScoreHistory does, since GameState itself only ever
 * tracks a player's *current* gold, not a running production total.
 *
 * Mirrors buildTurnReview's (./turnReview.ts) two-pass approach for
 * RESOLVE_UNIT_ACTION: the official applyAction call is what every later
 * action in the replay actually builds on, while a parallel per-assignment
 * pass (applyUnitActionEffect, one call per unit) is what tells two
 * different units' gold gains apart within the same submission. Unlike
 * buildTurnReview's events (which only cover the actionType subset it maps
 * to a UnitReviewEventType — notably missing region-unit-count-income),
 * this attributes ANY positive gold delta an assignment produces, so every
 * gold-producing effect (income, produce, trade, region-unit-count-income,
 * and a trade-resource sell) is counted. A trade-resource buy (spends gold)
 * simply produces no positive delta to attribute. All assignments in one
 * RESOLVE_UNIT_ACTION are attributed to the chosen card's kind, same
 * convention as buildTurnReview — a companion piece's own gold gain is
 * folded into the card's kind rather than the companion's, matching how the
 * engine's own turn-review already treats it.
 *
 * Like calculateScoreHistory, filters `actionHistory` down to
 * resolveHistory's `.effective` (./historyFold.ts) up front, so an
 * UNDO_ACTION/REDO_ACTION entry (design change, issue #412) neither breaks
 * this loop nor counts gold from a branch that got undone away.
