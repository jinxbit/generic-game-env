       * Below the `sm` breakpoint, the height cap lives on this wrapper, not
       * the `<svg>` itself. An `<svg>` sized via `width: 100%` with no
       * explicit `height` derives its height from `viewBox`'s aspect ratio —
       * capping *that* element's own `max-height` makes a tall/narrow
       * board's computed height exceed the cap, which per the CSS
       * replaced-element sizing algorithm shrinks the `<svg>`'s *width* too
       * (to preserve the aspect ratio), leaving it narrower than its
       * container with empty space beside it. Bug report: "on mobile, the
       * victory screen is sometimes scaled incorrectly" (a board that was
       * tall relative to a narrow mobile viewport's width, rendering at
       * roughly half width with the other half blank). Capping this
       * wrapper's height instead leaves the `<svg>` always full width — a
       * board taller than the cap now scrolls vertically within the wrapper
       * rather than shrinking horizontally. On a narrow screen that's the
       * right call: width is already the scarce dimension there, so it's
       * worth keeping maxed out even at the cost of a bit of vertical
       * scroll.
       *
       * At `sm` and up, width is no longer scarce — the platform's
       * game page content column leaves a wide board plenty of
       * room to shrink into without becoming cramped, so the tradeoff flips:
       * the `sm:` classes below move the cap back onto the `<svg>` itself
       * (`h-auto w-auto max-w-full`, letting both dimensions shrink together
       * instead of just height) and `sm:mx-auto` centers the
       * narrower-than-container result. That's the same shrink-to-fit
       * mechanism this comment warns against for narrow screens above,
       * deliberately re-enabled here because on a spacious desktop viewport
       * it's exactly what keeps the whole board on screen without a scroll
       * or an out-of-band browser zoom. Bug report: "on a non mobile device,
       * the map is displayed in a way that is too big to fit the screen, so
       * a scroll or resize are needed" (issue #623) — the wrapper-only cap
       * left the `<svg>` at full (large) container width regardless of
       * viewport height, so a board tall relative to that width still forced
       * the wrapper's own vertical scroll to see in full.
       *
       * `svh` (small viewport height), not `vh`: `vh` is defined against the
       * browser's *largest* possible viewport (address bar/chrome hidden),
       * which on mobile is taller than what's actually on screen at page-load
       * time (chrome still showing) — so a board capped in `vh` could render
       * taller than the real visible area and need an unwanted scroll before
       * the player has done anything (issue #575: "game map should fit the
       * screen on default"). `svh` is defined against the smallest possible
       * viewport instead, so the cap never exceeds what's actually visible.
       * `src/index.css`'s `body { min-height: 100svh }` already relies on the
       * same unit for the same reason.
