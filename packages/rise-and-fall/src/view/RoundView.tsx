 * Backs issue #528's "Reveal all cards" confirmation: while `shouldStage` is

 * calling `submit`, so a player who's about to be the one whose pick
 * resolves the select-cards/decline phase gets a chance to review — and
 * change — their pick behind `confirm` before anything is actually sent.
 *
 * `shouldStage` is recomputed by the caller every render straight from the
 * live, server-synced `pendingPlayerIds` — it is not a snapshot taken when
 * staging began. If another player retracts their own pick while this one
 * sits staged, this player is no longer the one who'd trigger a reveal, so
 * `shouldStage` flips to false — but a card the player staged themselves is
 * a real, not-yet-submitted decision of theirs, so it must never fire just
 * because *someone else's* action changed `pendingPlayerIds` (issue #546:
 * player A retracting their pick used to auto-submit player B's still-staged
 * one). The staged pick is left in place either way; `stagedCardId` only
 * ever leaves state via `confirm` — an explicit click — or `choose` staging
 * a different card. The caller uses `shouldStage` itself to relabel the
 * confirm button ("Reveal all cards" vs. plain "Submit") once it no longer
 * describes an actual reveal.
