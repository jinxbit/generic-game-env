/**
 * One hand-drawn silhouette pictogram per unit kind, replacing the old
 * single/double-letter text label (see unitKindLabel.ts, now unused) —
 * design proposal reviewed and approved before wiring in here. Each icon
 * is a handful of basic shapes on a shared 24×24 grid so every glyph sits
 * at the same optical weight.
 *
 * Contrast is guaranteed structurally, not per-icon: HexBoard.tsx draws
 * every glyph in one fixed ink colour on a fixed light "plate" behind it
 * (not the player's colour — a marker filled with the owner's colour
 * couldn't guarantee the glyph read clearly against every one of the four
 * player colours, which is what prompted this). Ownership instead shows as
 * a small colour bar beneath the plate; the glyph is sized to spill past
 * that bar's edges on purpose.
