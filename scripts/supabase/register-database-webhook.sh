#
# Registers (or re-registers) Supabase Database Webhooks for one Edge
# Function, without touching the dashboard.
#
# A "Database Webhook" is not a separate Supabase object: the dashboard's
# Database -> Webhooks screen creates an ordinary Postgres trigger that calls
# `supabase_functions.http_request(url, method, headers_json, params_json,
# timeout_ms)`. audit-and-fix-migrations.yml already relies on that fact (it
# redacts those trigger definitions out of schema dumps, because the
# `x-webhook-secret` header value is stored in them in plaintext — pg_dump
# masks `Authorization` and nothing else). So anything the dashboard can
# register, SQL can register too, which is what this script does: it sends
# the SQL over the Supabase Management API's query endpoint using the same
# SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN the setup workflows already hold.
#
# Why this exists at all: before it, every "Set Up ... Notifications"
# workflow stopped one step short and printed "now go create N hooks in the
# dashboard and paste this secret into each". For the lifecycle
# notifications that was six hooks per Supabase project, each
# with a hand-pasted secret — the step most likely to be got wrong, and the
# reason rotating a webhook secret was a chore rather than a button.
#
# Registration is idempotent and rotation-safe. WEBHOOK_HOOKS describes the
# function's hooks in full, not an addition to them: every existing
# http_request trigger pointing at this function is dropped first, whatever
# table it is on and whatever it is called, so
#   - re-running with a fresh secret updates the header instead of stacking
#     a second hook (which would double every notification),
#   - a hook originally created by hand in the dashboard is adopted rather
#     than duplicated, and
#   - a hook on a table the function has stopped watching is removed (this is
#     what retires the lifecycle functions' old `game_state` hooks, now that
#     game-finished pings come from the turn functions) instead of invoking
#     it for nothing on every write.
# The match is on the function URL *including its closing quote*, so
# `notify-web-push` never matches `notify-web-push-lifecycle`.
#
# Required env:
#   SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID    project ref (the api subdomain)
#   SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN  Supabase personal access token
#   FUNCTION_NAME          e.g. notify-discord-lifecycle
#   WEBHOOK_SECRET         value for the x-webhook-secret header
#   WEBHOOK_HOOKS          space-separated <table>:<EVENT>[,<EVENT>] list,
#                          e.g. "players:INSERT games:UPDATE game_state:UPDATE"
# Optional env:
#   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY      Authorization: Bearer value for the hook. Deployed
#                          functions verify a JWT unless configured otherwise,
#                          so the hook has to send one — the dashboard fills
#                          this in for you. Left unset, the script copies the
#                          header off an existing webhook trigger, and failing
#                          that asks the Management API for the anon key.
#   SUPABASE_API_URL       defaults to https://<ref>.supabase.co
#   MANAGEMENT_API_URL     defaults to https://api.supabase.com
#   WEBHOOK_DRY_RUN=1      print the SQL that would be sent and exit 0,
#                          without calling anything (this is also the SQL to
#                          paste into the dashboard's SQL editor by hand)
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  hooks registered (or SQL printed, under WEBHOOK_DRY_RUN)
#   2  automation unavailable — the Management API query endpoint could not
#      be used, or no Authorization header could be resolved. Callers should
#      fall back to printing the manual dashboard instructions; nothing was
#      changed.
#   1  the SQL itself failed, i.e. something is wrong that a retry of the
#      same run will not fix.
