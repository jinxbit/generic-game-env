# Drops and rebuilds a Supabase project's `public` schema so the next
# `supabase db push` re-applies every migration from scratch — the
# "drop everything and reinstall" half of .github/workflows/rebuild-preproduction.yml.
#
# Runs over the Management API's query endpoint, the same mechanism
# set-chat-enabled.sh and register-database-webhook.sh already use (POST
# {MANAGEMENT_API_URL}/v1/projects/{ref}/database/query with
# SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN), so it needs no database password and no direct
# network path to Postgres.
#
# WHY A RESET IS EVER WANTED: pre-production accumulates state that no
# migration describes — throwaway smoke users and rooms, hand-run SQL, and
# (the case this was written for, todo.md #139) a migration applied on the
# project that has since been reverted out of the repository, leaving a
# `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations` row with no file behind it. Rather
# than reconcile that by hand, rebuild from the migrations and let the repo
# be the only source of truth.
#
# WHAT IT DESTROYS: everything in `public` — games, players, game_state,
# profiles (including `is_admin`, which is granted by hand — see the
# profiles section of 0001_baseline.sql — and is therefore NOT restored by a
# db push), chat, push_subscriptions. Also clears the migration history so
# every migration re-applies.
#
# WHAT IT LEAVES ALONE: the `auth` schema (accounts, identities, sessions)
# unless WIPE_AUTH_USERS=1, `storage`, and the `supabase_realtime`
# publication itself. Dropping the tables removes them from that publication;
# the migrations re-add them idempotently on the way back up
# (0001_baseline.sql guards its `alter publication` with a `not exists`
# check), so Realtime comes back without manual help.
#
# Required env:
#   SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID              project ref to reset (the api subdomain)
#   PRODUCTION_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID   production's ref — this script REFUSES to
#                                    run when the two match. Not optional:
#                                    an unset guard is treated as a broken
#                                    guard, for the same reason
#                                    deploy-supabase.yml's "Refuse to touch
#                                    the wrong project" treats it that way
#                                    (the 2026-09-09 incident, where an
#                                    environment missing its own project ref
#                                    inherited production's).
#   SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN            Supabase personal access token (not needed under DRY_RUN)
# Optional env:
#   MODE=inventory                   report what is there and exit without changing anything.
#                                    Prints ONLY the JSON result, so a caller
#                                    can parse it; the prose belongs to the caller.
#   TOLERATE_MISSING=1               with MODE=inventory, report `{}` and warn instead of
#                                    failing when the schema isn't there to count (a project
#                                    that is already torn down, or half-way through a reset)
#   WIPE_AUTH_USERS=1                also delete every row in auth.users
#   DRY_RUN=1                        print the SQL that would be sent and exit 0
#   MANAGEMENT_API_URL               defaults to https://api.supabase.com
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  done (or SQL printed, under DRY_RUN)
#   1  refused, or the SQL failed. Unlike set-chat-enabled.sh there is no
#      soft-fail arm: a half-applied reset must fail the run loudly rather
#      than let a later `db push` land on a schema in an unknown state.
