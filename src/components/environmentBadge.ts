// Decides whether the running build should announce which backend it is
// talking to, and what to say.
//
// The app is configured entirely at build time (`src/lib/supabase.ts` reads
// `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` out of the bundle), so a deployment looks identical
// whichever Supabase project it points at — there is nothing on screen, and
// nothing short of reading the built JavaScript, that distinguishes
// pre-production from production. That ambiguity has already caused real
// mistakes: see DELIVERY_PIPELINE_PLAN.md §8 on an environment deploying to
// the wrong project because nothing said otherwise.
//
// `isProductionBuild()` (src/lib/environment.ts) is the shared predicate
// behind this file's gate and also guards guest sign-in (src/lib/auth.ts) —
// keep them using the same convention rather than each reimplementing it.
//
// So: `VITE_ENVIRONMENT` is set ONLY on non-production builds (Vercel's
// Preview scope). Production leaves it unset and therefore renders nothing —
// the safe state is the one that needs no configuration, rather than one
// that depends on remembering to set a variable correctly.
//
// The Supabase project ref alone turned out not to be enough to tell builds
// apart: every Preview deployment — `main`'s and every `claude/*` branch's —
// points at the same Preview project, so the badge read identically on all
// of them. That once cost real time: a checkbox looked
// absent because the page was an older branch's preview, not `main`'s. So the
// badge also names the git branch and short commit it was built from, read
// from `__GIT_COMMIT_REF__`/`__GIT_COMMIT_SHA__` (injected by
// `vite.config.ts` from Vercel's `VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_REF`/`VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA`
// build-time env — see that file). Those are empty outside Vercel, in which
// case the badge just omits them rather than showing something misleading.
