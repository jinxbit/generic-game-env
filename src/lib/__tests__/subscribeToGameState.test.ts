// Regression test for issue #646: subscribeToGameState used to discard the
// realtime `game_state_meta` payload entirely and unconditionally pay for a
// fresh fetchState() HTTP round trip, even though the payload already carries
// the row's new `version` and the caller (GamePage.tsx's applyGameStateSnapshot)
// was going to throw the result away anyway whenever it wasn't newer than
// what's already applied. The common case this wastes bandwidth on: a
// player's own submitted move already applied the resulting state locally,
// then the `game_state_sync_meta` trigger's own update to `game_state_meta`
// echoes back over the same client's realtime subscription.
//
// This stack (src/test/supabaseStack/) doesn't model Realtime itself
// (database.ts's own doc comment) — only Postgres and the Deno runtime are
// doubles, everything else, including the websocket transport, would be the
// real thing, which a plain Node test runner can't open a real connection
// over. So instead of a live socket, `supabase.channel(...)` is replaced with
// a stub that captures the `postgres_changes` handler subscribeToGameState
// registers and lets the test invoke it directly with a synthetic payload —
// everything downstream of that handler (the version comparison, the
// conditional fetchState() call, and that fetch's real HTTP round trip
// through the stack) is the real gameApi.ts code running unmodified.
