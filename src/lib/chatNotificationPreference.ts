/**
 * A per-account preference (`ProfilePreferences.chatNotificationsEnabled` in
 * dbTypes.ts): whether posting a message in a game's chat should trigger the
 * existing Discord webhook / Web Push notification for the game's other
 * seated players (`supabase/functions/notify-discord-chat`,
 * `notify-web-push-chat`) — see CHAT_PLAN.md §20. Originally defaulted to
 * **off**: those two channels already ping on every turn/lifecycle event
 * with no per-event toggle, so a player who set either up for that purpose
 * would otherwise start getting a ping per chat message with no way to have
 * opted out in advance. The default is now **on** instead — most players want
 * to hear about chat, and requiring an opt-in was hiding the feature from
 * them; a player who wants turn pings without chat noise can still opt out on
 * the Profile page. The preference is resolved from the stored value at read
 * time rather than stamped in at profile creation, so the new default applies
 * uniformly to every profile, old or new — there is no old-row/new-row split
 * to preserve here (unlike `ruleEnforcementEnabled`).
