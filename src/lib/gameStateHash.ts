/**
 * A stable fingerprint of a client-shaped `GameState`, used by the delta read
 * path (`get-game-state`, `gameApi.ts`'s `getGameStateRedacted`) so a client
 * that rebuilds the state itself can prove it got the same answer the server
 * did — and fall back to a full fetch when it didn't.
 *
 * WHY THE HASH EXISTS: the delta protocol has the client replay the actions
 * the server sends rather than being handed a materialised state. That is
 * only safe if a client running a *different* engine than the server — a PWA
 * holding a stale bundle after a rules change, which is normal operation
 * here, not an edge case — can be detected. It converts engine skew from a
 * silently wrong game view into a cache miss.
 *
 * TWO THINGS IT DELIBERATELY EXCLUDES, both learned the hard way:
 *
 * 1. **`actionHistory` itself.** `applyAction` stamps `new Date().toISOString()`
 *    on every entry it logs (applyAction.ts), so two independently-produced
 *    states never agree on timestamps even when every game-logic field does.
 *    Hashing the log would make the check fail *always*, which would look
 *    like the design not working rather than like a serialisation bug. Only
 *    the log's **length** is folded in, which is enough to catch a client
 *    that spliced the append at the wrong offset — an error that would
 *    otherwise pass verification silently and leave the game log and the
 *    Undo button wrong.
 *
 * 2. **Key order.** `JSON.stringify` preserves insertion order, and the two
 *    sides reach the same state by different paths (the server from a
 *    gunzipped row, the client from a replay onto a cached base), so
 *    structurally identical states can serialise differently. Keys are sorted
 *    recursively here so that cannot produce a phantom mismatch.
 *
 * The hash is FNV-1a, not a cryptographic digest: it guards against accident,
 * not against an adversary. The server is already trusted for the state
 * itself, so a stronger hash would defend nothing, and a synchronous one
 * keeps every caller free of async plumbing. (gameStateCache.ts uses the same
 * primitive for its own integrity check — `fnv1a` is shared from here rather
 * than written twice.)
