// Replays recorded games — exports in the app's own "Copy game export"
// format — against the production-simulating Supabase stack
// (src/test/supabaseStack/).
//
// Every game export dropped into src/test/fixtures/productionGames/ becomes a
// suite here automatically — no registration step. What each one asserts is
// that the game *replays*: submitted action by action, by the seat that
// actually submitted it, through the real apply-action/undo-action/
// redo-action Edge Functions, against a database that enforces the same RLS
// and the same optimistic-concurrency contract production does — and that the
// state that lands in `game_state` at the end is the state the game
// finished with, down to the winner.
//
// That makes these regression tests for the whole write path at once. A rules
// change that alters how an old game resolves, an enforcement check that
// starts rejecting a move real players made, a compression or trigger change
// that corrupts what gets stored: each shows up here as a specific action
// number in a specific real game, which is a much better bug report than
// "some test failed".
