// Runs the production smoke runner (../productionSmoke/runSmoke.ts) against
// the in-process stack instead of a real project.
//
// The runner exists to be pointed at production, where a mistake in it costs a
// failed nightly run, some manual cleanup, and — worst case — a room left
// behind in the live database. That is a bad place to discover that its
// provisioning sequence, its id remapping or its teardown is wrong. The
// in-process stack answers the same PostgREST, GoTrue and Edge Function
// endpoints a deployed project does, so the whole runner can be exercised
// here on every PR: it creates users, signs them in, opens a room, seats
// players, starts the game, replays a recorded game, and cleans up, without
// knowing it isn't talking to Supabase.
//
// What this can't prove is the thing production runs prove — that the
// deployment is live and correct. The two are complementary on purpose.
