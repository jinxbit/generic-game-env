// Puts a recorded, finished game into a live Supabase project and LEAVES IT
// THERE, so the maintainer has something to open and poke at by hand
// (DELIVERY_PIPELINE_PLAN.md §6 step 3: "go and test it" should cost a click
// rather than fifteen minutes of setting a game up).
//
// This is the smoke test's provisioning and replay, with the two properties
// inverted that make a smoke run safe and a seed useless:
//
// - the room is **public**, not private, so it appears on the Public Rooms
//   screen and can actually be found;
// - nothing is torn down on success, so the room and the accounts that played
//   it survive the run.
//
// Everything else the smoke test's isolation rules ask for still holds, and
// for the same reasons (see ../productionSmoke/README.md): `play_mode: 'live'`
// so neither notification function can page anyone about a game nobody is
// really playing, and throwaway accounts rather than anyone's real one.
//
// The throwaway accounts are deliberately NOT deleted: `players.user_id`
// references `auth.users` with no cascade, so deleting them would either fail
// or strand the room. They are the cost of a seeded game, and the reason this
// is for pre-production only — see ../../../.github/workflows/seed-preview.yml,
// which refuses to run against production at all.
