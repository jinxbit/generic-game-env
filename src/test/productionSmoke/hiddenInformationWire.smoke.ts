// The production entry point for the hidden-information wire check: runs
// ./hiddenInformationWire.ts in full (get-game-state, apply-action, and a
// real Realtime subscription) against the real, deployed Supabase project
// named by the environment — see that file's own doc comment for what it
// checks and why it's a headless supabase-js check rather than a browser
// test.
//
// `.smoke.ts` rather than `.test.ts` for the same reason productionSmoke.
// smoke.ts is: vitest's default `include` only matches `*.test.*`, so
// `npm run test`/CI never reaches a live project. Runs only through
// `npm run test:smoke` (vitest.smoke.config.ts), alongside the fixture-replay
// smoke test — same workflow (.github/workflows/smoke.yml), same
// throwaway-user/private-room isolation (liveProject.ts), no separate wiring
// needed since that workflow already runs every `*.smoke.ts` file here.
//
// Everything this creates is deleted by checkHiddenInformationWire's own
// `finally` (room first, then users, same order/reasoning as
// provisionLiveRoom's doc comment).
