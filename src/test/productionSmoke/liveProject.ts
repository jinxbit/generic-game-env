// Talks to a real, deployed Supabase project the way a browser does: the same
// `@supabase/supabase-js`, the same anon key, a real signed-in session per
// seat, and the same `apply-action`/`undo-action`/`redo-action` Edge Function
// calls `gameApi.ts` makes. Nothing here is a double — this is the half of the
// testing story `src/test/supabaseStack/` deliberately cannot cover, because
// what it verifies is that *the deployment* works: migrations actually
// applied, functions actually deployed, RLS actually as written.
//
// It satisfies `ReplayTarget` (src/test/supabaseStack/replayFixture.ts), so
// the same replay routine that drives the in-process stack drives this, and
// a production run and a CI run disagree about nothing except the network.
//
// Isolation is the whole safety story, since this writes to the live project:
//
// - Throwaway users per run, created and deleted through the admin API, so no
//   standing credentials and no pollution of the real user list.
// - A `private` room, so it never appears on the Public Rooms screen.
// - `play_mode: 'live'`, never 'async' — both notification functions
//   early-return on any other mode (`play_mode !== 'async'`), so a replay
//   can't page anyone. Play mode is not part of the rules: the engine only
//   carries it, and the enforcement path treats live and async identically
//   (`isAuthorizedToActAs` requires an exact seat match for both).
// - Teardown deletes the game *before* the users. `games.created_by` and
//   `players.user_id` reference `auth.users` with no `on delete cascade`
//   (0001_baseline.sql sections 3 and 4), so the other order fails on a
//   foreign key and strands the room.
