// One production smoke run: for each eligible game fixture, open an isolated
// room on a real Supabase project, replay the whole recorded game through the
// deployed Edge Functions, check it finishes exactly where the recording
// finished, and delete everything it made.
//
// What this catches that `npm run test` cannot: a migration that didn't apply,
// an Edge Function that didn't deploy or won't boot, an RLS policy edited in
// the dashboard, an expired key, a Supabase platform change. The in-process
// stack (src/test/supabaseStack/) proves the *code* is right; this proves the
// *deployment* is.
//
// Deliberately written as a plain async function rather than a test body, so
// the identical run drives two entry points: ./productionSmoke.smoke.ts
// against the real project, and ../__tests__/productionSmokeRunner.test.ts
// against the in-process stack, which is what keeps this file itself honest
// in CI rather than only when it fails at 3am against production.
