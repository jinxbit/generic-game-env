// Runs ONLY the smoke test (src/test/productionSmoke/*.smoke.ts), which talks
// to whichever real deployed Supabase project the SMOKE_* environment
// variables name. Kept in its own config rather than behind a flag in
// vite.config.ts so there is no path by which `npm run test` — the one CI
// runs on every PR — can reach a live project: that config's default
// `include` matches `*.test.*` only, and this one matches `*.smoke.ts` only.
//
// `node` environment (this is server-side work, no DOM), no jsdom setup file,
// and a long timeout: a full game is hundreds of sequential HTTPS round trips
// to Supabase.
//
// `fileParallelism: false` (issue #573): this directory has exactly two
// `.smoke.ts` files, and vitest otherwise runs them concurrently. Issue #570
// fixed the proven cause of one red (a deploy's migration reshaping the
// Realtime publication mid-run) but explicitly left this alone, since that
// run's failure overlapped no deploy and a second, unproven theory — the two
// files contending for the runner's ~2 CPUs — could equally explain it.
// #573 repeated the exact same "no Realtime payload" failure on a run whose
// timestamps rule out any deploy overlap (the Actions API shows the deploy
// finished ~25s before the replay step even started), while
// `productionSmoke.smoke.ts` was mid-replay of a 700+ action fixture the
// whole time — confirming the second theory rather than a third one.
// Serializing the two files trades a longer total run (they no longer
// overlap) for not starving `hiddenInformationWire.smoke.ts`'s Realtime
// subscription of event-loop/CPU time while it waits on its 60s window
// (issue #555).
//
// `sequence.sequencer` (issue #598): serializing the files (above) does not
// fix what order they serialize in. Vitest's default `BaseSequencer`, with no
// prior-run cache to go on (a fresh checkout every time), falls back to
// "largest file first" — which is always `productionSmoke.smoke.ts`, since it
// is a few hundred bytes bigger. That means the Realtime-sensitive check in
// `hiddenInformationWire.smoke.ts` deterministically starts its subscription
// right after `productionSmoke.smoke.ts` has just pushed ~460 actions' worth
// of writes (plus its own room teardown deletes) through the same project's
// single Realtime WAL decoder — every run, not just occasionally. #598
// repeated #570/#573's exact "no Realtime payload arrived within 60s" failure
// on a run with no deploy overlap (confirmed via the Actions API, as #573's
// fix requires ruling out) and with the two files already running one after
// another (#573's fix, confirmed present and working from the log order), so
// neither previously-fixed cause applies — leaving this ordering as the one
// remaining, always-present, and avoidable risk factor: it guarantees the
// Realtime check runs immediately downstream of the one part of this suite
// that could leave the decoder behind. Sorting files by `moduleId` instead
// (plain alphabetical, so `hiddenInformationWire` < `production`) runs the
// Realtime-sensitive check first, against a project with no smoke-run traffic
// of its own yet.
